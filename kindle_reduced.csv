B00ALUMW96,"[4, 4]",3,"There are numerous books written on the subject of survival and disaster preparedness. While it does contain good information, it really doesn't make it to the top of the heap.In a guide specifically marketed to beginners, I really don't expect a ton of detail, but this book did surprise me with a a decent amount of detail. Yes, there is some helpful information in this book and even a decent amount of it, but the writing style and numerous grammatical errors found throughout are what lead me to pass on a recommendation.I gave it the amazon 3-stars for ""It's OK"". I was glad that I picked it up while it was available for free, but I'm also glad that I didn't pay for it.If you enjoy reading about prepping and survival preparedness, I also recommendUltralight Survival: Make a Small and Light Bug Out Bag That Could Save Your Life.","08 5, 2013",A1SKME00QMJR6,"J.

B00I2GZRLG,"[0, 0]",4,"Lost in You by Sommer Marsdenis a sweet yet passion-filled romance between two unlikely lovers. Clover Brite and Dorian Martin come from completely different worlds, but neither can resist their smoking hot desire. Both are carrying their fair share of emotional baggage and their promising relationship is threatened by Clover&#8217;s insecurities.Although Clover is the project manager for a renovation of one of Dorian&#8217;s properties, the two meet for the first time during a super-storm. Trapped at the mall by the weather, there is an immediate attraction between them. Clover is quite flustered at first, but Dorian soon puts her at ease and pretty soon the two are indulging in some scorching hot sex. But once she and Dorian return to real life, Clover&#8217;s issues jeopardize their fragile relationship.Insta-lust is rarely a firm foundation for a new relationship and in Lost in You, Clover and Dorian learn this difficult lesson fairly quickly. They are likable characters in the beginning, but once reality sets in, they become quite frustrating at times. Clover is young, but she has a heightened sense of responsibility which is a good thing for her career, but this spells disaster for her personal life. She also has unresolved issues stemming from her childhood and coupled with her awareness of the social differences between her and Dorian, she is quick to assume there is no future for them.Dorian is handsome, charming and refreshingly down to earth. He is in his mid-twenties and he is working hard overcome his playboy, party image. He never comes across as a snob or class conscious, so Clover&#8217;s reaction to the differences between them has no basis in reality and he never gives up on trying to convince her to give them a chance. He always remains a likable character but his pursuit of Clover becomes a little manipulative at times. It is a real turning point when he finally stops pursuing Clover and leaves the future of their relationship in her hands.Although Dorian and Clover are sometimes exasperating, the secondary cast of characters is superb. Clover&#8217;s grandmother and surrogate aunt Brani are absolutely wonderful. Their scenes are warm and witty and neither of them put up with Clover&#8217;s negativity.  Older and wiser, their advice to Clover is spot on and thankfully, she finally begins to listen to them.Sommer Marsden beautifully redeems both characters into well-rounded, appealing characters and Lost in You concludes with a highly romantic and deliciously steamy happily ever ending that readers are going to love.I received a complimentary copy for review.","06 10, 2014",A3RHTYOGSITLWN,"K.

B00I6BTALK,"[2, 2]",5,"These stories are about people that have super powers, they're &#34;infected&#34; is the term the public uses for them. Each book highlights one of the characters, but you'll get to know them all as it's one story line. Some are super strong, or fast, maybe they project a feeling onto others. They all have a first mode that they have to cope with, be it greed, shyness, depression or any of the common negative emotions we all have.Very well written, the books draw you into the lives of each of the people, and you will root for them and feel their pain and anguish when things are hard, or feel joy and happiness when things are going well. I enjoy how comedy is thrown in when appropriate and it gives me a smile or giggle.I bought this set for my daughter because it's SUCH a GREAT deal and I know she will enjoy them as much as I did.

I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that if we were going through a similar trial of our own, it would be almost too difficult to bear. In addition to that, the heroine, Katie is asked to perform an almost unspeakable task in the midst of her pain. That is a turning point for her, and shows her mettle and her character.The introduction of all of the other characters brought some fascinating layers to the story. These would be people that I would love to be around, and have around me when going through hard times. And times were hard in the 1800's. People needed each other back then. They weren't isolated like we are today, and through good times and bad, your friends, neighbors, and family were there for you. I found this enjoyable to read about.The author also skillfully wove moral values throughout without being preachy. Yes, there were Bible verses, but they applied to the story and also gave the book a ""soul"", so to speak, that I have not found in reading other romance novels.

B008GBCCMO,"[3, 3]",5,"When we start Vampire Betrayed, we find a couple in bed having sex.  Interesting way to start the story.  The two main protagonists are Joaquin, who is a vampire, and Ariana, a human.  The key to the beginning of this story is that Ariana has no idea that Joaquin is a vampire.  She knows he has some strange habits, but their lovemaking was great, and he was wonderful with her.  But then Ariana begins to get strange emails from someone unknown with comments about the man she is sleeping with....the man you are with isn't who you think he is.....Ariana pressures Joaquin to tell her more about himself, and he becomes suspicious and finds out about the emails.  He finally tells her that he is a vampire, and she laughs.  There is no such thing as vampires.  So she thinks..... Joaquin has feelings for Ariana, more then he has ever had for a human woman, and he asks her if she trusts him.  She leaves to take a walk, and that will be the last time either see each other for 6 onths.What happens thereafter is very exciting.  Charon is a powerful vampires, who wants to rule the world. She also has magical powers, given to her by a Shaman, making her even more powerful.  Charon wants Joaquin dead, as he is the only person standing in her way of taking control. She befriends Ariana, under the guise of protecting her against Joaquin, and then uses her powers to make Ariana think she has been beaten, and Charon  saved her.  Charon tells Ariana that she is a vampire hunter, and wants her help to save the world.  Using her illusions on Ariana to hide the fact that Charon converted her to a vampire, and trains Ariana to be a vampire hunter.Joaquin of course is still looking for the missing Ariana, with help from his friend Devlin.  Over the next few months, it becomes apparent that with the rise of vampire slayings, Charon has converted Ariana.  Of course, Joaquin can't understand why Charon is having her kill vampires, but over time he will see it is a plot to kill him.This was an excellent story, a different type of theme with Ariana not knowing what she was due to the illusions, and becoming an excellent fighter.  The story was very exciting, especially the last half of the book.  Charon was a good villain, and Ariana turned into a great heroine.  I really liked Joaquin, who really loved Ariana and would do anything to save her.  Great story, the best of this series so far, with excellent characters and a super ending.","08 1, 2012",A32HPEJOM37MF4,"Barb thereadingcafe ""Barb""",Wonderful and fun short story.,1343779200

But Cary's ex left him alone and struggling for reasons that reveal themself in the book, which just make you hate the guy even more. Cary's number one focus is little Gus and then his business the Dog Barkery. He hasn't dated since before Gus was born, and rarely hooks up. But there is something about the tall blonde that volunteers at the animal shelter that piques Cary's interest. When he meets his best friend out at a local gay bar for a drink, the last person he expects to see is Heath, the spine tingling sexy man from the shelter.Heath Cummings swings both ways, he's the if I'm interested in them the plumbing doesn't matter, type. Having married his best friend when they were young, dumb and got knocked up... only to loose the baby and almost his best friend, he has a strict 'no children' policy for the people he plays with. Yes, I said plays with, because Heath is out for numero uno only and the words commitment, love, and emotion are not in his vocabulary. That is until one tall, dark and handsome single father gets under his skin.A chance encounter ends with Cary in Heath's lap sans clothing at the Barkery, in Cary's office, and the two decide to use each other for weekly tire rotations. The sex is off the charts amazing, but soon both men find themselves getting more attached than the situation calls for. Cary is worried about bringing anyone into Gus's life, or falling in love with an emotionally unavailable man that will no doubt break his heart in the end. Heath is completely blown away by Cary, Gus and the every growing feelings he has for both of them. He didn't think he was capable of the love that he is starting to feel. And it scares the living crap out of him, literally. But communication is not either of these men's strong suit from the start, and one miscommunication too many threatens to implode their already fragile &#34;friendship&#34;.What an adorable, slightly angsty, definitely sexy, just a little quirky, sarcastic and emotional love story this was! I LOVED the inner monologue playing in Heath's mind at the start of the story. Boehme has this knack for creating realistically flawed characters and impossible relationships that turn into down to earth, good old fashioned love stories. Both men struggle for various reasons throughout, some of their reasons align while they also have very different reasons to doubt not only their ability to love, but to be loved as well. Boehme brought the emotions and the passion to the pages and had me hooked from the start and praying these two would pull their heads out of their {insert appropriate word here} and just commit to each other already!This is a must read for those that like a story that makes you &#34;feel&#34; because Keep Swimming will keep you reading, and feeling until the end. I was standing up in my bed screaming at my kindle toward the end, and then I was laughing and fist pumping the air.

When Amelia gets into trouble we get to see his softer side, which helps balance out his tough guy personality. The story was a bit slow at the beginning, and a little rushed at the end. I would have liked to see more jungle action instead of the whole set up to get to the jungle. I wanted to see them face the perils of the jungle that almost claimed the life of Aunt Pan.

With that being said the first few chapters of this book I found very hot the sex scene right off the bat put me in the mind of the 1st book Vanilla On Top.  It was my favorite part of the whole book.However, after that first scene I thought the sex scenes were just ok. I know their not BDSM but an exploration. The thing is you can do an exploration without doing the same ones you have already read half dozen times. I like uniqueness. I am however only 1 persons opinion. You judge for yourself.There was also some other things I didn't like about the book I thought Heather was a love struck teenager instead of the adult she is suppose to be. She turns out to not be my favorite character at all. She was always thinking of Tony 24/7 like she had no life of her own. Tony in my opinion was the whole focal point in this story since it really involved him and his ex.Now to talk about  the ending which was unpredictable of what was going to happen with Portia. However the ending was good but their was a lot of loose ends that needed to be tied up. Just seemed a lot to cram in the last few chapters and some things were left hanging.

Probably because I once wanted to be a lawyer and I grew up watching Ally McBeal with my mom, but either way I gravitate to author's like Julie James and now I can add NM Silber to that list! You don't have to be a law fan to enjoy her stories or understand what's going on. She has a fantastic handle on dumbing down law jargon for us non-lawyer pleabs.She also has created a fantastic group of characters that are hilarious and intelligent! It's my favorite combo when reading. Added to that, her characters are sexy. And not in an overt way. It's sexiness without brow beating us. It's romance without throwing a sex scene in every five seconds to say, &#34;See? They have a relationship!&#34; Because that's not a relationship, people. I like my characters to go on dates. I like them to fight about menial crap. I like them to have fun together and be sweet to each other. I love the build up to the first time.We get all of that with this novel. We even meet the parents! Which is probably one of my favorite parts, at least when they go to meet Gabrielle's family because her grandmother is an absolute head case. Think of the grandmother from Wedding Crashers, but more outspoken and crazy.I love that we get to see the progression of their love for one another. The first installment in this series is brimming with humor, intelligence, sexiness, sweet moments, and intrigue. I enjoyed myself ever single second! 100% recommend this to everyone!The Home Court Advantage - 4 Stars!Ok so we pick up right where we left of in book 1. Can I be honest in saying that I A) didn't know that the second book was going to be about Braden and Gabby and B) don't really think they needed a second book? Let me be clear though, while I do think/thought those things, I still really enjoyed The Home Court Advantage. It had all of the things I really enjoyed from the first installment. Hilarious court cases, fantastic dialogue, witty flirting, steamy sex scenes, and crazy family members. What I enjoyed even more was seeing more of their friends, whom I'm hoping play leading roles in the books to come!As far as the stalker element goes, it seemed to be overshadowed by everything else in the novel. It just didn't seem like a strong enough storyline, especially since it's what brought on book 2. I kinda didn't care enough about it. I was too interested in everything else that was going on! So if you're one of the people who are reading this series for the mystery (who are you?!), you may be a bit disappointed.All in all, it was a very enjoyable read.

The Embattled Road is the prequel to the series and centers around Marines Duncan, John and Chad, and how they were injured in battle and their immediate recovery. It also sets up the rest of the series by showing how the three of them come back together at the end.These three heroes each have physical and emotional challenges any Marine would have given the situation they lived through. It was very interesting watching them go through their hospital stay post injury and the road they each took from there.We don't normally get to see the gritty stuff like this in typical romance books so the truth and rawness of these stories pulls you in and really has you falling for these guys and cheering for them.The character development was well done and I really enjoyed getting each of their points of view. The thoughts and emotions of each of the men seem typical of what you would expect from their situation.Throughout the story, I felt heartache for Duncan, John and Chad, but also was able to laugh and cheer them on at times.

The fun thing is that they're never itching for an audience, nor are they disappointed, or shy for that matter, whenever they get one.  Cassandra weaves a story that holds a perfect balance of erotica and loving devotion and it's really a beautiful thing.HAIL MARI is the next story, written by Jami Davenport.  This picks up from somewhere in the middle of the last story from the point of view of a spectator from one of the locations of a tryst from ""the original couple"" (I will refer to them frequently, as they are the catalyst for a park full of naughtiness!).  Mari and Wyatt meet up once a year whenever he's in town, always pushing her to venture into more and more unfamiliar territory sexually.  After catching sight of a couple on a park bench, they decide to have a little fun of their own.  This encounter however, will lead them to a new place emotionally.  It starts off seeming like it'll just be a horny couple, but instead turns into a potentially life changing experience.TAKING IT OUTSIDE is the third story and the only one written by Cristal Ryder.  What disappoints me is that this is the only one by her, as it was my favorite in the book.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed them all, but this one had emotion, heat, and comedy.  Val and Tyler have a strong relationship and a healthy sex life - one that encourages a little adventure from time to time.  Val sets a sexy picnic in the park and tells Tyler to meet her.  While waiting, she sees a shameless couple up on one of the lookouts above the lake.  She's already hot and bothered by the time Tyler catches up with her.  They visually follow the couple, and use their antics as inspiration for their own.  Little did they realize they weren't the only voyeuristic people in the equation.  They get the surprise of their lives at a caf&eacute; later that leads to a little embarrassment, but many laughs.A WHOLE NEW WORLD is the fourth story, returning to Cassandra Carr.  Once again we're in the minds of two people who happened to catch sight of our original couple when they actually thought they were alone.  It leads to Ross confessing an exhibitionist side, and to Miranda deciding to explore the possibilities.  Ross is so respectful of Miranda as he tries to help guide her and ease her into different fun, public situations.  Miranda is so adoring in her desire to fulfill Ross's fantasies, and it leads to her finding a new side to herself as well as Ross.  This story is a little different because, the others seemed to be mostly about the man having the most control in any given situation, but this one is more give and take.  They push, challenge, and encourage each other.  It's really cute because he may push her limits, but she pushes his buttons and threatens his sanity, driving crazy.  It's also different because rather than spanning just the one outing, this story spans days, as the original couple continues to inspire them without ever needing to be seen again.IN THE OPEN is the final story by Jami Davenport.  In her first one, she introduces two couples, but only follows the one.  This follows the other, returning to the moment they're all caught up in the couple giving the poor park bench a work out.  It refers to a little more kink by bringing up plans of handcuffs and blindfolds, and the sex is a little rougher.  Jaid and Alex face two major conflicts, his reputation as a player and her being ten years older than him.  In the end, both struggles are the last thing on their minds.  This is also the most blatantly exhibitionist story in the book.  Yeah, they've all enjoyed an audience to some extent, but here our stars actually invite an audience and put on show.  That being said, it's also quite possibly one of the most emotional - the ending almost had me in tears!The bottom line about the book as a whole is that it's absolutely hot, completely sensual, and oh so very sweet - the authors deserve a pat on the back.  In its entirety, it was an utterly enjoyable read, and I will never walk through a park, or a mall parking lot for the matter, without wondering what I'm not seeing.  After all, who hasn't longed to be even a little bit of an exhibitionist or a voyeur (or both)? *wink***I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.**","08 16, 2012",A1TU1FRPVRWXFE,Hillary,"Fun, sexy read!",1345075200

She went into great details of the downfalls of drinking, the excuses/rationalizations people make to have one drink but end up finishing a whole bottle, and the positive outcomes of not drinking or limiting the amount of alcohol consumed can have mentally, financially, and spiritually.There was a part in the book where the author talked about the effects being hungover creates by spending money on alcohol and then having to spend money on eating junkfood since she couldn't cook, increasing her overall costs in general (I can relate to that because I have done that plenty of times and felt like crap mentally and physically) especially if this is a regular thing.

She reaches into our hearts and challenges us gently, yet firmly enough to waken us to our God-given servanthood.There are two primary women in this story.  One is Diana Kensington, a woman grieving the sudden death of her husband of many years.  She is a teacher at a private Christian school, even though her faith has been shaken, she hasn&#8217;t eaten a full meal since her husband&#8217;s death, and she sees little in her future.The second we are introduced to is a student who is brought to the school and scheduled into Diana&#8217;s home room and final period classes.  Scottlyn Rich is obviously pregnant, which is outside of all the policies of the school.  Scottlyn also has no knowledge of Christianity or our Savior, so this private Christian school would be a unique experience even if it weren&#8217;t a private school.  The only thing Diana sees when Scottlyn is delivered to her classroom, however, is a pregnant teen is her own judgment outweighing God&#8217;s mercy.  She is determined to do all she can to care for her unborn daughter, Mercie, whatever the cost to her.I absolutely highly recommend this to anyone in Christian service &#8211; each one of us!  Also for young adults, and those young ladies who find themselves in the challenges of teen pregnancy &#8211; no matter how the pregnancy came to be.  There are spiritual lessons to be had, perhaps a different one for each reader.  For Mercie&#8217;s Sake reflects a bright and shining light of our Lord&#8217;s love and provision, and encourages each of us to bloom where the Lord plants us &#8211; for His mercy&#8217;s sake.  Sharon has compassionately and gently written about timely and vital to our future as God&#8217;s beloved, and I hope to see much, much more by this author in the future.I received a copy of this book through the &#8220;For Readers Only&#8221; group at The Book Club Network, in exchange for my honest review.

I felt like I knew her and I liked her.~I loved her mother-in-law, Madame and her daughter Lucy.  They were well written and very believable.Areas for improvement:~I felt there needed to be more exploration of the romance/marriage of Vivian and her husband.  This would have added depth to the plot and given the reader a greater understanding of Vivian and the changes that had occurred to her since she was abandoned by Josh after their love affair ended. We saw how they met and a bit of what attracted Vivian to George, but I would have liked more of the story including how they got married and Vivian becoming pregnant.~I felt there needed to be more exploration of Vivian's relationship with Alex (her brother) and more detail of their relationship growing up.  The author makes Vivian's childhood trauma an explanation for many of her adult life choices and yet I felt I was short changed on  both what occurred to her as a child and her relationship with Alex and his role in her childhood. I felt like her reconnection with Alex was just thrown into the book as an afterthought and seemed a bit unbelievable.","09 8, 2012",A1G0YD6MSY8GBP,willis9301,Good but needed more development of certain relationships,1347062400

Most people seem to have loved Tyler from the get go and I've been determined to stay away from that. Especially when it comes to the whole shipping Tyler and Vaughan thing. I mean, why must we have to pair people up and make couples out of everyone??? This is like a running theme in every book! Readers are always begging for every character to find a life partner and they always grasp for that life partner to be the first single girl/guy that comes into view. And in this case Tyler is the girl who comes onto the scene and poor Vaughan is probably gonna be matched with her some day just because she was the closest available option. Grrr. Can't we just wait and see if there are other options out there people?But despite my obvious dislike for a Tyler/Vaughan relationship in the future and despite my irritation with Tyler's grating personality (I mean, did you see her in the last episode? She was impossible!), I couldn't help but start to actually, kinda, maybe like Tyler in the episode. Ah!I know! I'm horrible!

B0054TR7GM,"[1, 1]",5,"A man who protested alongside black South Africans for the end of apartheid, freelance journalist Robert Dell is a devoted pacifist with a deeply ingrained sense of justice. When his wife and children are killed after a truck deliberately forces them off the road, Dell's grief turns into outrage when he is accused of being the one responsible for their deaths.Initially placing his trust in the justice system to set things straight, Dell quickly realizes those responsible for the deaths of his family have connections in both the police force and court; he's being railroaded, and the only way he can prove his innocence is to bring down the real culprit. Not an easy task, and one with which Dell reluctantly accepts his father's help. Ironically, his father, Bobby Goodbread, was himself only recently released from prison, where he was serving time for his involvement with death squads under the apartheid government. Fortunately Goodbread is still connected to his old network, because the man he and Dell are after is big game.Inja Mazibuko is both a corrupt police officer and a Zulu Chief. He also happens to be suffering from full-blown AIDS, a situation he intends to cure with a traditional remedy; marrying a young virgin. His intended, 16-year-old Sunday, wants nothing to do with the warlord but has little choice. Her shot at salvation comes in the form of Disaster Zondi (who also appeared in Smith's Mixed Blood), a former police officer who returns home in order to lay the demons of his criminal youth to rest. When Zondi inadvertently receives an invitation to the wedding he realizes he may actually know Sunday, and that under no circumstances can she be allowed to marry the vicious Mazibuko.Author Roger Smith weaves the threads of these five individuals' lives into an intense, evocative, and ultimately stark tapestry. Though most are familiar with South Africa's apartheid past and its fall, few are probably aware of the current state of the country. Smith very adeptly uses the plights of the individual characters as embodiments of the challenges facing the country itself. The struggle for justice and redemption that Dell, Goodbread, and Zondi are wrestling with serves as a mirror for the country's struggle to find the same, while Mazibuko and Sunday are reflections of the dichotomy of the Zulu culture; one foot planted firmly in the past, the other striding toward a new, more enlightened future.It's not often something so bleak can also be beautiful, but Smith paints such a vivid, realistic picture of the characters and their hopes and motivations that one can't help but appreciate and be overwhelmed by the desire for happiness they - and the country - are all striving to reach in their own ways. Smith's writing is a master class in how to create a novel that speaks to the reader on multiple levels, as well as how to infuse a work with a message without beating the reader over the head with it. Dust Devils is truly powerful writing.","07 27, 2011",A3Q3UTXQT1E3U8,Elizabeth A. White,Truly powerful writing.,1311724800

Wannabe actresses are often depicted as dim-witted and naive, unequipped for survival. Lacey proves otherwise. When L.A. is invaded by gigantic alien cockroaches, she goes to war, quoting Lao Tzu and Machiavelli, improvising weapons based on in-depth knowledge of entomology and pest control methods (dad was in the business).Strange things happen in this book and, inasmuch as it is only volume 1 of a series, they only go from normal to bad to worse; no happy ending.At first, I thought it was intended as humorous, misled, in part by this description of a chick who enters Lacey's bar (""a man magnet, stick-thin, long straight thick blonde hair, probably enhanced by extensions, big silicone tatas, and large blue vacuous eyes""), visits the restroom, and is disemboweled by an unseen monster. What I took as dark humor was actually only the beginning of big bug trouble in L.A.The plot unfolds as Lacey experiences signs of unruly nature (meteors, earthquakes, thunder), weird local events (spooky noises, bad odors, plumbing problems, black mists), odd sightings (space ships, large insects), news reports of large bugs and warnings to avoid.She eventually experiences the effects of alien invasion first-hand, moving through a landscape filled with human corpses, hiding, escaping, and taking up arms against the onslaught. Toward the end, she kills a bug, fashions a disguise from bug remains, visits the bug lair, moves among the invaders, and hitches a ride on one of their craft.What happens next? In the final chapter, the story is left unresolved, though Lacey states her determination to pursue the foe by saying, ""I was Lacey and my business was pest control.""Was I supposed to laugh?","10 15, 2013",A2ZMWTHONRIW1I,O.

I wanted to love  'Vital Sign'  as much, but it definitely did not have the appeal of the 'Wrecked ' series. Still, it was still a nice story. I guess I just felt the story was very predictable, and I found myself creeping ahead in the book- even just a chapter or two, which is something I never do. I finished it because I wanted to see how the book ended, but it did not really hold my interest. Probably, because it was so predictable. I did love the fact that we were given an epilogue, happening a year and a half down the line, so we are left with a HEA. A nice love story- but don't expect anything like Wrecked'.

B00CCI6D2W,"[0, 0]",5,"I can honestly say that I was scared to read this book. Jason was such a whirlwind of destruction that I had such a love/hate relationship with him in Red Flags. He showed such potential to be everything Cara needed and then because he couldn't just be honest about his past, their world crumbles.When I started reading Enlightened I was taken by surprise. In most sequels, the characters fall right back into each other's arms within days and sometimes within hours but, Cara, stood her ground and began moving on. I loved that Jason didn't force his way back in to her life, he simply stayed in the background and waited.  He would send her sweet little texts and gifts just to remind her that he was there and that he still loved her.Things seem to be going good for Cara, new look, new job, great friends but, she has a hallow feeling her that only Jason can fill. She knows that he never intended to lie to her but, how can she trust him to be honest with her? She learns very quickly that Jason Bradley is everywhere, he has left his mark on just about everything she runs into. Her job is no exception. The question that constantly ran through my head while reading this, Why does everyone blame Jason for their mistakes? I started to feel bad for him, he may be tainted by his past but, he doesn't deserve the world of grief people throw at him.With the help of Cara's friends and of course Jason changing to prove to Cara he is worth it, Cara gives in to being with Jason. I really liked Mila, Ryan, Hunter and Chelsea. They showed Cara that things are not always what they seem and even though they had their own reservations about Jason, they seemed to be rooting for him.Things aren't all pretty and perfect for Jason and Cara, there are still the people from Jason's past that rear their ugly heads, trying to drive a wedge into their relationship. There are many unexpected things that happen, that I'm not going to ruin for you. Stacy, the apparent baby mama, is a piece of work and I was literally clapping when Cara got her two cents in with that girl.Jason won my heart in this book. He proved he could be more and that his past can't rule his present. He stepped over the people holding him back, let go of the guilt and made right what he wronged with Cara.C.C Brown really did an amazing job with this series. Her writing is unique and her imagination is incredible.

B00LPPDXC6,"[0, 0]",5,"When Brigham Vaughn asked if I would be willing to beta read Equals, I jumped at the chance.  I have read a few of her short stories and I adore her writing style.  It&#8217;s clean and precise and a joy to read.  This book is no different.  I marveled more than once how smoothly the story flows and how easily Brigham describes simple little things in a very meaningful way.  Here is one example:&#8220;Stephen had carried both of their suit jackets over his arm, so as not wrinkle them, and when he carefully laid them on the tan leather backseat of his Mercedes, Russ felt a funny lurch in his stomach he couldn&#8217;t quite identify.&#8221;Nice twist on the &#8220;I saw my toothbrush next to his..&#8221; analogy that has been done a thousand times too many, huh?  I loved the visual I had of Stephen being so careful and Russ seeing their jackets lying together and having it trigger something inside him.I personally love May/December romances because my husband is quite a bit older than I am.  It&#8217;s not always an easy dynamic, either in real life or on the written page.  I have truly only read one other book (Years by Lavyrle Spencer, a M/F story) that did it well - without the older man coming off as a father figure, which totally turns me off.  I&#8217;ve never read a M/M story with more than a ten-year age difference.  There are twenty-some years between Russ and Stephen and Brigham not only pulled it off, she nailed it.It&#8217;s not love at first sight, but the chemistry between Russ and Stephen is instant and believable.  When Russ is injured in a fall caused by Stephen&#8217;s spilled coffee, Russ&#8217;s annoyance and Stephen&#8217;s guilt and eagerness to help in every way possible is completely realistic.  Russ really has no choice but to accept Stephen&#8217;s offers of assistance and before long, things begin to sizzle.  Because of Russ&#8217;s injuries they are kept from acting on their attraction physically.  This forced abstinence is as sexually charged for the reader as it is for Stephen and Russ.  One scene in particular, that begins with a race in the rooftop pool, threatened to melt my Kindle into a shiny, black, plastic puddle.The angst whore in me was also well satisfied.  Without any spoilers, there were a couple of parts that just made my heart hurt, but Russ and Stephen are both smart men and they got things worked out to my satisfaction.I appreciated that Ms. Vaughn showed how annoying &#8220;outside opinions&#8221; of a May/December relationship can be.  The exception to this is Russ&#8217;s roommate, Monty, who has a special knack for saying totally inappropriate things, but I give him a pass because he cracked me up every time he appeared.I thoroughly enjoyed this story from beginning to end.  My only complaint was I wanted more &#8211; much more &#8211; of Russ and Stephen.  Imagine my giant smile when I saw the cover sporting the words &#8220;book one&#8221;.","07 14, 2014",A71ZQ1QYHLGXE,Janet Ellinger,Finally - a May/December romance done right!,1405296000
B00EUBGMB6,"[0, 0]",5,I was lucky to receive this in a giveaway but would have purchased it anyway as I love this authors work.K is a member of the Purist alliance -a Paladin-and as such feels virtually no emotions. Her only wish is to survive and progress until she finds total silence. Whilst on a routine mission she is captured by Boone as he believes he needs a Paladin to get him onto the planet where his sister is being held captive.The bulk of this story is about the journey they take and how it changes them. Boone is a giant of a man and yet is such a compassionate individual that K is constantly thrown off balance. K has had a life lacking in comfort and as she's used to being encased in a suit that pumps her full of drugs to suddenly be without it is shocking. She has been taught that any skin to skin contact would contaminate her and yet her body cries out for sensation. Knowing that K is just a means to rescuing his sister Boone is finding difficult not to want to protect her. As for K she begins to realise that the Purist way may not always be right.This is a lovely story set in a sci fi world that tries to imagine what it could be like years from now. Earth as we know it no longer exists and humans have been forced out into space and adapted as they can. This is essentially a romance although I felt it was a sensuous read and not hard core erotica that might put some readers off. It was really nice just to drift away into the world that the author has created and I look forward to reading more from her.Definitely recommended,"09 18, 2013",A34B6NBZL1IRNX,"Marta Cox ""marta""",Amazing world,1379462400

B00B000PCW,"[1, 1]",4,"This story is pretty good, especially when you consider how short it is.  While the story is well written, character development is a bit lacking (which is often the case with stories as short as this one.)  Jillian is one determined heroine.  When her father betroths her to man old enough to be her father, she stows away on Vane's ship.  Jillian's plan is to convince Vane to play knight in shining armor and rescue her from her unpalatable fate.  Vane, however, is not so willing to simply throw away his freedom.  Jillian has to dig into her bag of tricks in order to convince Vane she'll make him the perfect wife.Although the story is pretty good, I really wish we were given more background information about Vane and Jillian's relationship.  We are told that they've known each other for three years, and it's pretty obvious they have both harbored some feelings for one another...Jillian more so than Vane it seems.  However, the background information we are given is more hint than anything else.  Nonetheless, this story makes for entertaining reading.If you're in the mood for something short and sweet, this book might just be the ticket.  FYI, this is a clean romance.  Happy reading!  As a side note, I can't believe the $2.99 price tag for this and other St. Claire short stories!  IMO, this book shouldn't cost more than .99 cents.

B0086O623Q,"[1, 1]",5,"Desmond Cory's novel ON THE GULF was unfinished until this now extraordinarily fine novel was completed for the purpose of placing it on Kindle - the people's available book reading place. Probably Cory with his futuristic imagination knew his books would survive the myriad permutations of the publishing world. For those who may not remember, Desmond Cory is a pseudonym used by British mystery/thriller writer Shaun Lloyd McCarthy (Lancing, Sussex, February 16, 1928 - January 2001) - a writer whose novels were overshadowed by Ian Fleming's mega-success with the 007 series, but whose main character Johnny Fedora predated James Bond and to many the public came to expect even more from Cory's colorful action, copious carnage, elaborate intrigue, frequent surprises: for many the Fedora plots were more complex and intellectual. As one critic stated, `I must say that I find Cory's Johnny Fedora a much more persuasive violent, sexy and lucky agent than James Bond.'ON THE GULF is possible one of Cory's finest novels, not depending on the personas such as Johnny Fedora or Professor John Dobie to  attract the reader to a familiar style. This novel, set in a fictional Gulf state of Fariq (based in the Middle East where Cory lived for a number of years): despite the fact that the novel is some years old now since its writing, the locale and the atmosphere and  the political and cultural aspects of the themes Cory paints are surprisingly timely, given the current bellicose situation in the Middle East at present. Yes, the expected Cory tension and intrigue and embellishments into sensual situations are present, but in this mature novel  the focus is not just on action, but also on psychological insight into the characters. It is a blisteringly fine read and feels like the matrix of a very successful film adaptation. Highly recommended.

There is a fine line between Love and Hate and let me tell you that between Madison and Rick that line truly revolves around them, never have I read two characters who not only want to kill the hell out of each but also want to protect them, cherish them and finally love them.  But the beauty of it all they make it look freaking amazing the back and forth and let me tell you that with all name calling, pissing contest on who is in control of the other that this sort of foreplay is scortching.In other words Rick has finally seen the light that as much as he cared for Daniela he realized that he is not the kind of man for her and she is not the type of woman that he needs and wants.  After all his schooling with Madison the realization hit him harder than he knew, that he needed someone to wants and accepts him as he is truly is with no what if's,and's or but's about it, and all this time she was there standing beside him helping him get the girl of his suppose dreams.  I can honestly tell you that Rick has done a whole 360 here, yes he is still the arrogant man we met in The Do Over however, he steps up to the plate big time.  And he is relentless in his pursuit of everything and anything having to do with Madison Stuart.Madison is troubled by her past as strong willed as she is, she still is a broken inside from a long ago love, her parents distaste for her, and dealing with the b.s. of her brother and his side kick.  Her past is as tarinshed as an old penny but the amazing part of it all is that Rick doesn't care one bit (again he has truly come around).And just in the nick of time cause Madison will have her wilk tested and she will need strong hands to help catch her.The chemistry, loathing and mutal love and  respect that both characters have for each may not be for everyone but for them it works. The madness of loving someone is worth it.","01 30, 2014",A1EOFNV23D0GV2,janette ramos,MIAMI HAS GOTTEN HOTTER SINCE RIC GOT HIS GROVE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1391040000

I have very mix feelings about this book but I can't ignore the fact that I was pulled into the story within the first 2 chapters.  I guess I will try to do this without giving to many spoilers as it is a shorter book.Evie, I loved Evie. She was fascinating to me. I love how she had a strong confident side throughout most of the book. We did get to see some of her insecurities but it was more because she was in love with her best friend Jay, who happened to be dating her roommate, Cynthia. We see her struggle with the decision on what to do about it.Jay's character was also well written. He is a football player up for the Heisman trophy so I expected him to get cocky and be a total player, but he was the complete opposite from what I expected, which is a nice change. Sure he had a moment or two but who doesn't, right? I hope when the next two books come out we find out more about Jay's background. I wanted to know more about him, about his background and family life. How he met Evie and so forth.Cynthia, Evie's roommate and friend. I am not sure how I felt about her.  She was written well for her part in the story line but she was so whiny and insecure. I couldn't get a feel for her because I want to know why she is the way she is. Again not trying to spoil anything but she is the way she is because something terrible happened to her, at least that is what I am led to believe but I have no idea what it was.Then enter Pipe, he was a great edition to the story. He is the gay best friend to Evie and Jay. He definitely helped the story along and he helped give insight into Evie's background with Jay but not much. It was a nice character add by the author.Now, I am not sure how I feel about the ending. I almost feel like I needed more explanation on her choice at the end. It was almost out of character for her to give in so easily when she warred with herself for days over it.  I also didn't like the wishy-washiness of Jay and deciding on his feelings.  This is also why it seemed out of sorts when Evie made her decision about things. It was like she became weaker towards the end, not the strong girl we were introduced to. It may have something to do in the future books of this series but I guess I will have to wait and see!I also want to warn readers that there is a bit of voyeurism and non-traditional relationships in this book, so if that's not your cup of tea, you might want to think about this purchase before you make it. I have an open mind and will read anything but for those uncomfortable with it, just caution yourself if you pick this up.With that said, again, I quite enjoyed the book and read it in one sitting.

B00K6IBRYE,"[3, 3]",5,"Carried Forward By Hope, Book 6 of The Bregdan Chronicles series, by Ginny Dye begins with the ending of the Civil war in America and the soldiers returning home to find their families. It is the year 1865. After the war ended the beloved President Lincoln freed the slaves in the south and had great plans to move the country forward.  Unfortunately the great president was assassinated and suddenly the people acquired a new president to take his place.  It didn't take long before the people realized this president didn't have the same ideals as their past leader and the country would have a difficult time in trying to heal.Ginny Dye is a great historian and story teller.  I love her characters in this book. I feel like a part of their family and want them to thrive and achieve their goals of reconstructing their lives and help the freedmen and people of the south that were defeated after the war.  I have learned how people must have felt going through the hard times of despair and pain, mentally, as well as physically.  This is a story of people, men and women, black and white, northerners and southerners.  This was a time when freedmen wanted their rights and women wanted to vote and the haters of course making this virtually impossible.  Love, passion, romance, hate, despair, cruelty and happiness will rip through you while reading this wonderfully written book.  I suggest you get a copy of the first books in this series.  I am looking forward to book #7 (Glimmers of Change)!","06 2, 2014",A2JA4I3PD0OY14,Monica McDaniel,Passionate Story,1401667200

The second book is just as intriguing as the first.Although there is not quite as much excitement in Give Me Hope as there was in its predecessor, there is still plenty of mystery.  Who are angels and who are demons?  Who are just plain folks? If you are an angel (or demon) will you recognize one of your own kind (or the opposite)?  Are Mikah and Vivienne soul mates or will fate keep them apart?There is a tiny bit of sex in this book (maybe a 2 at the most out of 5).  The hope that Mikah and Vivienne will eventually get together (and you know it will be awesome!!) is what drives the reading of this sequel.Not surprisingly, there is a third book coming in the series, which I hope will tie up all the loose ends and finally give us readers some satisfaction.I received a complimentary copy of this book for the purpose of review.

The real us.""Aubree Walker has a secret. A huge secret. It is for this reason that she's been avoiding her home town and everyone in it for nine months. Once high school was over, she all but fled town to a college in the city.But escaping your past isn't always possible...Aubree gets a phone call in the middle of the night--her aunt, her guardian, took a fall down the stairs in her home and is now in a coma. Aubree wastes no time. She hops in her car and heads home.Upon her arrival she's ambushed in the darkness and rain. She doesn't see a face, but it's obvious someone is out to get her.Enter Booker Outlaw. Bad boy. Town pariah. In love with Aubree since high school.Booker rushes in to save the day, but seeing him brings Aubree nothing but awful memories she only wants to forget.But someone won't let either of them forget what they did last summer.- - -Alright, where to begin? This is one of the best New Adult reads I've devoured in months! They all sort of seem the same to me at this point. With sooooo many of them out there competing for ratings and reviews you've got to bring something unique, something different, something new. I feel Zoe Dawson did this. Is there steamy romance? Yes. Is there angst? Yes. Is there pages and pages of sexual tension? Sure enough. But this book is more than just that. It's more than just a story of a damaged girl waiting around for a man to save her from herself or someone else.Aubree Walker is far from a damsel in distress. She was in such a position once before and refuses to let it happen again. It had dire consequences. So she throws herself into her college education. She's super smart and enjoys leading a plain, calm life at school. When she gets the call about her aunt being in a coma she is devastated. As a child Aubree watched her junkie mother die right before her eyes. With no father in the picture, Aubree's aunt steps in. She takes Aubree in as her own and couldn't have been a more amazing, loving parental figure. So it's a no-brainer for Aubree to go back home regardless of her fears. She's a strong, determined woman.Let me tell you ladies (and maybe gentlemen!) something. A Perfect Mess has triplets. TRIPLETS. Tall, dark, sexy-beyond-words, bad boy triplets! Boone, Braxton, and Booker. *fans self* The Outlaw triplets are the best part of this story. Each of them has something unique about them. Booker is a wealthy author working behind a pen name. This guy has been in love with Aubree since high school, and maybe even before that. When she shows up in town after leaving nine months ago without even a goodbye, Booker is torn between being angry and ecstatic at her return. The two of them share a secret that could be their undoing.The book is told from their duel first-person perspectives, which I absolutely LOVED.I always enjoy reading from a male POV. I think Zoe Dawson embodied the male mind quite well. Booker is all kinds of messed up because of Aubree. As he says many times, she just gets to him. Their romance is tentative at first, but as with most New Adult couples, the lust overtakes both of them. And this is when the #1 thing I loved about this book happens.Not only do they have sex, which I don't feel is a spoiler because it's completely expected from any book in this genre, but it's done through Booker's POV. This was not something I expected AT ALL, but I freaking loved it! You almost always see this from the woman's POV and it's always the same ol' spiel. I won't break it down, because we all know it. Zoe Dawson, for whatever reason, decided to do it through Booker's eyes. It was amazing! One of the best love-making scenes I've ever read. It made my face heat-up and my heart beat double-time. It was very memorable and will probably ruin every other NA book for me for life. :)Another unique thing about this book is the mystery aspect. What is the secret? We can guess, and there are hints, but the truth doesn't come out 'til later on. I think Zoe Dawson did a great job with the mystery.This is where I am going to come in with my negative points.I am going to try and tell you what I think without directly giving you a spoiler, but please be warned that what I say may make it easier to guess! SO, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!Alright. Aubree and Booker aren't the only ones with a secret. Aubree's aunt has a secret as well, and it's huge. It was when this secret came out that I got sort of confused.This secret is so big and unbelievable that I feel anyone would question it and have doubts. Not Aubree. She accepts it without batting an eyelash. She barely even asks a question! I mean, I just don't understand. I also don't really feel like this particular element of the story had a point. It wasn't something that needed to be there. I feel like it crowded the storyline; made it sort of messy, I guess.But it really pales next to how great the rest of the book is. :) The characters are memorable and their personalities so strong.So with that being said... Overall, I loved A Perfect Mess! It surprised me and it was one of the most engrossing reads I've had the pleasure of reading this year. The romance is steamy and angsty, but it's also much deeper than just that. The characters are multidimensional and very very memorable. There is also quite the element of humor in this book! I found myself laughing out loud many times. There's also the mystery, the thrill. Dawson created a great mystery and left no loose-ends. She kept me guessing and sitting right on the edge of my seat. So you've got the mystery, the romance, the secrets... There is drama and heartache. There is anger, pain, love, acceptance.I definitely recommend this book to those who enjoy New Adult romance. It's a stand-out book for me. It's also book one in a series. That means more Outlaw brothers! SWOON! &#9829; So, go go go! Read it. Love it.","09 28, 2013",A2IHBYQAW5MAJN,Literary Meanderings,New Adult romance with a dash of mystery!,1380326400
B00J1SP9FI,"[0, 0]",5,"So I picked this book up late in the evening a few days before this tour thinking &#8220;I&#8217;ll get started and take my time.&#8221; Uh, no! Instead I stayed up until 3:30am that same night to finish it. I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down! Those Slater boys (yes ALL 5 of them) are sexy and funny and Bronagh and her sister Branna were hilarious and feisty. The story line seriously had me from page 1 and didn&#8217;t let me go.Dominic and Bronagh start off with a hate-hate kind of relationship. He torments and teases her just to have an excuse to be close to her and she fights back (verbally and physically). You can just tell it&#8217;s one of those situations where they are both fighting their attraction (definitely on Bronagh&#8217;s part). Dominic is possessive (even way before they get together), protective, can be a prick, and sexy as all get out. Bronagh has spent the last 9 years of her life shutting everyone out except for her sister. He really gets her to come out of her shell and let people in. I absolutely loved the dynamic between them as well as the relationships she develops with his brothers. All of the characters had very unique personalities and I loved getting to know them.This book flowed really well. It felt like everything naturally progressed and it wasn&#8217;t forced. I was totally absorbed by the story and the characters. Did I mention that this whole book takes place in Dublin, Ireland? Yea it was really fun to read about characters from there. I don&#8217;t get to do that too often so it was fun. The Slater brothers are from New York so there were a few instances where language differences happened to create some interesting situations.

She was determined to to things on her own terms, refusing to bow to the demands of others. She was clever, though oddly unconcerned about her reputation, and her antics brought a lot of fun to the book. I thought she was lovely.Lucas seemed like a domineering jerk at first, to be brutally honest. But, as the book went on, we see why he acted the way he did and that there was a whole lot more to him than what he showed. Underneath all that strict control, he was very sweet, protective of his loved ones, and determined to ensure his family's fortune after his father squandered it. I really liked him. He was rather adorable.The romance was lovely. Pippa and Lucas were great together. I wasn't really feeling it, though, because Pippa spent most of her time focused on defying Lucas and Lucas spent most of his time trying to keep control. But, I thought it was sweet that, despite all that, their feelings for each other still grew. Not to mention the sizzling chemistry between them. Overall, I thought they were a wonderful couple.The plot was well paced and I was kept interested the entire way through. This book was so much fun to read, just to see the crazy things Pippa did to prove a point.

B00CE4A8UM,"[1, 1]",4,"I am a huge fan of Evangeline Anderson's and there is not much I have read by her that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. Having said that I must be honest and admit that the first book in this new series ""Crimson Debt"" was not among them. I am not a lover of romance stories being told in first person with only one of the main characters telling the story. I knew going in that this series of hers was written that way but I figured I would give it a shot anyway. In ""Crimson Debt"" the female lead, Addison, is the first person point of view throughout. I might have been able to handle that except I found her character very unlikable, even going so far as to say she was a heroine that was TSTL (too stupid too live) at several points throughout the book. Sorry, Evangeline but I had to agree with the few people who gave that book a lower star review. I found very little to redeem her in my eyes and because I didn't know what Corbin was thinking at any time in the novel I just never got why he even fell in love with her in the first place.Why am I even bringing up that book or did I even consider reading the sequel ""Scarlet Heat"" do you ask? Simply because I really wanted to find out what happened to Victor and Taylor and I was willing to give this series another chance. I am so glad that I did because everything I disliked about the first book Evangeline fixed in the second. Though the story is still told in first person point of view, she alternates sections between both of the main love interests. Being able to know what was going on in Victor's head as well as Taylor's was so much more enjoyable to read. Even Addison didn't seem as obnoxious in the scenes she was in.Victor and Taylor's story was told beautifully and you really felt for both characters. Even though much of the book was based on misunderstandings that could have been easily avoided if the characters just talked to each other, it really worked for this story. Some of Evangeline's best writing is done with characters that have been horribly abused, both physically and mentally and this one is no different.So if you read ""Crimson Debt' and felt like I did about it, I am hoping this review will convince you to give ""Scarlet Heat"" a try because I really don't think you would be disappointed. I am also interested in the third book in this series coming soon ""Ruby Shadows"". I am curious to see how Evangeline manages to redeem a demon like Laish. Plus I can't figure out if Shadowlock is going to be the villain or if Evangeline might be making the next book a menage. You never know with her!While the Brides of the Kindred is still my all-time favorite m/f series by her, this series has definitely piqued my interest now.

When all of a sudden your laying in bed reading it and you have to look around and see if your husband or boyfriend is looking at you. Because the look you have on your face is a really big smirk and your face is red from reading all the sexual innudendo. If you haven't read this series. You must start at number 1 and read all the way to the third one. Because in this book they mention characters that you read about in the first or second one. The third book is about Alana Gore.She is a publicist to the famous sports athletes and famous political people. Well one day Alana kept on getting death threats and she started to get really nervous about what could happen to her. So she decides to get a body guard to help protect her until she finds out who is sending her letters and leaving clues about wanting to get even with her or to kill her. She hires Chandler. He is a hot guy that owns his own bodyguard company. Well his brothers really don't care for her because of what she put them through. You will read that in the first and second book to this series. Well the tension between these two are so strong it's hard to cut it with a knife. You will be reading along and you can't believe what some of these characters have said because you only think it. You never say it outloud.So if you are looking for a series that you could finish in a week because they are a real page turner. This series you are thinking about at work, in the car or when your making dinner because you want to find out what happens between these two. So don't walk run and get this series and read it.

B00CJBOL5I,"[3, 3]",5,"A white-knuckle action/thriller that reminded me of Alistair MacLean's finest, Dangerous Games: A Jake Collins Novel by Paul A. Rice (@RiceAuthor) picks up right after the events at the end of Tears in Tripoli (see my review) as former-Special Forces soldier-turned-security-consultant Jake Collins recognizes an extremely dangerous -- and thought to be dead -- international terrorist in a New York airport.Old dogs don't forget their tricks, so Jake follows this terrorist and in the process stumbles into a situation that he'll need all the years of training and experience acquired working and fighting in some of the world's worst hellholes to get out of. The stakes aren't just his life but more importantly the lives of all the people in his life Jake holds dear.I greatly enjoyed getting to know Jake in Tears in Tripoli, but must say from the onset that in Dangerous Games we're getting to see a somewhat different side of our narrator-protagonist. His steely determination and quick thinking are again on display but here he's under enormous pressure, back in post-revolution Tripoli and forced to suppress his emotions while desperately searching for any sliver of a chance to turn the tables. There is really no way to say much more without spoiling the fun for future readers.In my early teens I stumbled across a paperback copy of Alistair MacLean's The Guns of Navarone in my school's library; from the first paragraph I was hooked and in short order I began to read everything of MacLean's that I could get my hands on. Explosive action, a steady undercurrent of tension, and steely-eyed men placed in impossible situations by forces beyond their control -- these are hallmarks of MacLean's early masterpieces, and readers will find those same attributes in Dangerous Games as well.A note on the final chapter: I don't usually read other reviews before preparing my own, but I glanced at one for this book in which the reviewer stated the final pages were totally unnecessary. If looking at just the main plot of Dangerous Games, I don't disagree the book could conclude with the penultimate chapter -- that's probably where Hollywood would roll the credits, too.However, as someone who became invested in this character called Jake Collins over the course of two gritty and tense novels, I was glad to spend that final chapter with him. In fact, I'd be happy to spend more time with Jake in the future.","08 6, 2013",A1UP17Q8BUIHU4,Scott Whitmore,White knuckle action/thriller,1375747200

Not very often is a reader treated to such an opportunity as YOU can have to read such a series of books as the Alex The Fey series.  If you like your books full of: action and adventure; wholesome values of friends, family, love - of friends, family and country - character, integrity, consistency of and persistent growth of person - including making and recovering from mistakes; romance; intrigue; strength of characters; suspense; international events - this series has it ALL.What raises this series above all and makes it my Once in a Lifetime series is because the books all give glimpses into the WHAT and HOW of creating and maintaining the lifetime values mentioned above.  I remain in awe of the environment that the author has created within which the characters ""live"".Of all that these book give to the readers, my most favorite is the HOPE in the human condition that can be summarized in the following quote from The Fey herself.  I have to set the stage somewhat.  The Fey and her team specialize in rescuing hostages - WORLDWIDE.  Research and captive interviews show that THE most important thing that keeps hostages alive during captivity is HOPE in rescue.  Here is how The Fey creates that HOPE:""I will come to get you,"" she said in his ear.  ""Anywhere, any time.  It's my job to show that to the men.  Not to play it safe.  Not to be safe.  But to prove to every service member that no matter what hole, bayou, jungle, frosty plain, or sand trap they are lost in, I will come for them.  That belief has saved a lot of lives.""WOW - love, love, LOVE it!

The story is not my normal genre I'm just not a fan of futuristic stories (tend to weird me out) but this was such a great adventure. The characters, as usual, were so likable I was sad when I had to let them go. Libby Drew has an unmatched talent of creating the best &#34;damaged characters&#34;, characters that are emotionally raw and sometimes make questionable moral decisions (these are my favorite characters in most any book I read) and in this book it was Saul. Saul was so relatable and troubled I was attached to him from the beginning and Reegan was the best possible counterpart for him with his childlike awe and humor. Despite how descriptive and absorbing the author's characters and world building was the story line and plot never faltered.

While I've heard that fish oil is good for you, this book really helps explain all the benefits of fish oil and the various studies that have been done with fish oil.  I really appreciated the author's honest and factual perspective on what fish oil does and does not do for the body.  Also, there are chapters on how fish oil helps heal various ailments, as well as prevent diseases.  There is a chapter about inflammation which was really fascinating; I never realized how many diseases it causes and how fish oil can reduce this. Overall, I found the book very detailed and factual, easy to read, and a great resource for anyone wanting to improve their health by eating more fish or taking fish oil supplements.","04 3, 2013",AZ1I9U14U9LX4,Katie W.,So Many Benefits of Fish Oil I Never Knew About!,1364947200

B00IA6QWP8,"[15, 15]",5,"Just when I think S.E. Hall can&#8217;t top the amazingness that is Dane Kendrick or Evan Allen, she goes and makes us fall head over heels in love with Sawyer Beckett. As soon as you open the book, prepare to surrender your panties to Sawyer. He&#8217;s the perfect package. He&#8217;s walking sex, his inner monologue is hilarious, he knows what girls like, and his best side is the inside. Cheesy, I know. But, he has the biggest heart behind all that tattooed, pierced, muscle-y hotness. He is loyal, caring, knows exactly what to say, and goes above and beyond for the people he cares about. What&#8217;s not to love about him?&#8220;Because from the day I first saw you until the day I saw you again, I didn&#8217;t like where I was. Now you&#8217;re here and I do. So it stands to reason that staying with you, wherever it is we&#8217;re going, is my best course.&#8221;I can&#8217;t say much about the plot without spoiling anything, so here&#8217;s a vague outline. In the prologue, we are reminded that Sawyer saw Emmett at Parker&#8217;s bachelor party. She was a terrible stripper, and Sawyer is immediately drawn to her. Unfortunately, they were unable to talk that night and Sawyer has no way of tracing her. Fast forward to see Sawyer banging his pain. He goes through countless girls to try to erase the emptiness he feels inside. He can&#8217;t stop thinking about the girl who got away.&#8220;I have no idea why it takes some couples years to fall in love and some only a day, or if any of them even know. But I do know that I like you, so much. I want to know you, and I think you want the same thing.&#8221;They finally meet again, at one of Sawyer&#8217;s not-so-finest moments. It&#8217;s pretty funny. And pretty soon, she gets a job at the K, the Club Dane owns and Sawyer manages. But, it&#8217;s not smooth sailing from there. It might have been love at first sight for Sawyer, however, Emmett has her secrets. The sexual tension builds as Emmett tries to resist Sawyer despite their obvious chemistry. I loved the build-up, but even more I loved watching them let go of their inner demons and slowly fall in love with each other.&#8220;I told you. I warned you, Sawyer, don&#8217;t give me your heart.&#8221;&#8220;I know you did, and I&#8217;m not pressuring you, but some things you can&#8217;t call the shots on. I&#8217;m not sure if I gave you my heart or if you stole it, but either way, I don&#8217;t want it back.&#8221;I felt like the plot line for Entice was a lot heavier and even more emotional than its predessors in the Evolve series. I think it might just be that S.E. Hall&#8217;s writing is getting even better. I don&#8217;t remember laughing this much with the other books. It might be because the book switches between Sawyer and Emmett&#8217;s POVs, and Sawyer is downright hysterical. This book put my heart through the wringer for sure. It was full of ups and downs, and the best part was that they were real-life problems. It was just too easy to empathize and fall in love with Sawyer and Emmett.&#8220;You scare the s*** out of me beautiful Emmett, with how fast, how hard you completely mesmerized me. One day you might figure out I&#8217;m an ass and run screaming, but I&#8217;ll chance it. I&#8217;ll risk anything to keep myself by your side as long as possible.&#8221;I don&#8217;t know if I can classify Sawyer and Emmett&#8217;s relationship as insta-love or a friends to lovers story. But I think it&#8217;s both, If you read Emerge and Embrace, you would know how S.E, makes her characters fall in love. She shows that there&#8217;s some sort of inexplicable pull between the two characters, but she lets you come on the journey with them as they fall in love fast and hard. I love it.&#8220;You don&#8217;t need me to save you, Sawyer.&#8221;&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t. You already did. And I&#8217;d love nothing more than the chance to show you what I can be.&#8221;&#8220;You already did.&#8221;&#8220;Oh, Em, you have no idea. There&#8217;s so much more I want to show you.&#8221;Sawyer makes a complete 180 in this book. It&#8217;s unbelievable how once Emmett comes into his life, he changes from a boy to a man. He did a lot of growing up in this book. Of course there are other factors which make that possible, but those are spoilers. I definitely swooned over the things he said and did for Emmett. And, god, is he sexy. I can&#8217;t even. All I have to say is: DJ Booth. Read it to find out what I&#8217;m talking about. Oh, and all his nicknames for Emmett? Swoon, swoon, swoon. Freaking killed me with all those terms of endearment.&#8220;The thought of losing him is suffocating, a sadness so bone deep I can&#8217;t take a full breath. I don&#8217;t even remember who I was before I let him in anymore. I don&#8217;t think I ever want to. The only Emmett I want to be is his Emmett.&#8221;Emmett was more of an enigma. Sawyer wears his heart on his sleeve, but Emmett is a lot more guarded. It takes a while for her to open up to Sawyer, and even when she does, she keeps thinking that she could never deserve a guy like Sawyer and that he&#8217;ll be leaving soon. Once we learn her reason for thinking like that, it makes a lot more sense, however, all it does before that is cause more sexual tension (no complaints here). I admired Emmett&#8217;s strength and her determination. It&#8217;s no wonder Sawyer fell in love with her so quickly. She is just as selfless and caring as Sawyer is.&#8220;I knew the minute I saw you that you&#8217;d be the end of me. I was right. You&#8217;re it. You&#8217;re all I see. You&#8217;re all I think about. I love you, Emmett.&#8221;And of course, we get to catch up with the Crew. One of my favorite circles of friends. I get to see my fave, the adorable Evan, and his love, the equally adorable, Whitley. And we get to see more of caveman Dane, and the most stubborn woman alive, Laney. I loved seeing how much they&#8217;ve grown up in the past year or so. They&#8217;re just as close-knit and entertaining as ever. I will be sad when we eventually have to see them go.&#8220;Thank you. Thank you for being exactly who you are and loving me exactly how you do.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about all that, but I will always love you the best I know how.&#8221;Evan will always be my favorite Evolve boy, but I know for a fact, that everyone is going to fall in love with Sawyer. We get to see him in a completely different light in this book. Who knows, maybe we&#8217;ll get some people to convert to Team Sawyer which means less competition for me for Evan. Sawyer and Emmett are so perfect together, even when they forget it. They bring out the best in each other, and their love is the kind that changes lives. I was extremely pleased with how this book turned out, and I congratulate S.E. Hall on creating yet another story of finding yourself and falling in love.&#8220;The only way I know how to give all I am to one person is the way I am with you. So babe, I&#8217;m kind of a work in progress, but I&#8217;m your work in progress. Only yours, ever, forever. I don&#8217;t want to be away from you, Em. I don&#8217;t want to miss another thing.&#8221;","02 12, 2014",A17EWXEFBXHAZ3,Trish Santos,The Sawyer book I never knew I wanted...,1392163200

B005Q22CEY,"[2, 2]",5,"Ahhh, you can never have too many books about Angels. Especially when the lead character is a feisty, sarcastic redhead who's mouth tends to get away from her. Dayton, the main character of the story, has had a rough few years and the chip on her shoulder has only gotten bigger. Unfortunately her future isn't looking like it's going to get any easier.Dayton and her sister Amber lost their parents at a young age. With no real family to care for them they are sent to the Abbey to live with their cold, uncaring Aunt, who also happens to be the Abbess. Thankfully for Dayton, or Day as she's frequently called, she has a true friend, Monroe. Day just does not fit in at the Abbey. She's always swearing, eating Dum Dums, talking back and just plain causing trouble. Everyone avoids her, even her sister, and she just doesn't know why. Well, she soon going to find out.Monroe comes from a Wiccan background and has always had visions. She's been having a recurrent dream involving Day and it's leaving her, and their group of friends, with a bad feeling. They want Day to leave the Abbey as soon as she can. Where would she go? She has no other family and she's still in high school, so living on her own at this time just isn't an option. And even though there's distance between her and Amber she just isn't ready to leave her. So she stays.....which is why her future just took a change for the worse.It seems that Day is half Angel, thanks to her father. She quickly finds out that Angels and Demons do exist. Just her luck, now she's bonded with a Demon and numerous other Demons want her dead! Luckily for her, she's bonded with one of the strongest Demons and has some magical friends to help her out. Unluckily for her, the bond she now shares means they feel each others pain and can both die.Will Day get out of this alive? Can she ever recover from the deep deception she experiences at the hand of her own family? Will she choose the good or bad side in the age old love triangle? Guess you'll have to pick up Redemption to find out! With a cast of magical characters, a witty, sarcastic dialogue and a little bit of romance (but enough to keep it PG) you won't be sorry.

B005Z37B90,"[0, 0]",3,"I read The Seeds of Wither after finishing The Chemical Garden Trilogy. I had hoped that it would give some additional insight into one of the characters (specifically Rose). The Seeds of Wither, at 77 pages includes content from the first book Wither which I always find awkward considering the reader that is purchasing the novella has already read the novel. It also included a small excerpt from Fever, which at the time hadn&#8217;t been released and made a little more sense. Though for me, I&#8217;d already read it the novel and didn&#8217;t seem worth the purchase.The new novella, &#8216;The First Bride&#8217; Short Story as titled in the contents, is about Rose. From the first page they are married with Rose a mere eleven years old. It continues to just briefly touch on their first kiss, burying their child and then focuses more on Rose&#8217;s decline in health. Rose tells Linden that he must remarry and let it be a muse &#8211; someone that will encourage him to draw again. Of the 77 pages, 13 was &#8216;The First Bride&#8217;. Not much for new content if you&#8217;ve finished the series.Included in The Seeds of Wither was also a map of the wives floor. Included on the final page was a link to the Fever Cover Reveal (behind the scenes video of the cover shoot) and the book trailer for Wither. I&#8217;m not sure if either of those videos are available to readers that haven&#8217;t purchased The Seeds of Wither.All in all, I rated the entire book The Seeds of Wither three stars based on content. The good it came with: a new novella, a mere 16% of the book (and a rehash of information we already knew about Rose), the wives map and two exclusive videos. For the date of its release, it included an excerpt of Fever which was highly anticipated by readers. The unnecessary (and the content that always annoys me to be paying for a second time after already previously purchasing the first book): several chapters from Wither.","03 31, 2013",A3NS2ZZYH6GOV1,Write Away Bliss,Nothing Really That New,1364688000

Ok...maybe because I'm not use to this type of storyline a few things had me smh. For starters I don't really know why this is in the romance category. Maybe that's the norm, but there were like three love scenes in this book. Then the story itself was so full of crazy and unnecessary drama that the explanations at the end just fell flat. It could have been less drama with a more believable ending and it still would have been good. I was happy with the end but I just feel like it was too late to make up for the very busy body of the story. Lastly, the editing once again was horrible. It really does take away from the flow of the story, and when you're already semi disappointed in what you're reading it sucks even more.

Although the thought of returning makes him uneasy, Tony also realizes that the personal demons destroying his peace of mind need to be put to rest. It isn't long before Tony and Carlos realize that this increasingly bizarre case could involve supernatural elements. A visit to local witch, Lilith Adams, verifies that she's partly to blame for Tony's bad memories. The question is whether Lilith is involved in these suicides. Is she intending to help or thwart attempts to find the truth?Eye of the Witch is the second installment in a series that incorporates mystery, the supernatural, witchcraft, and even romance. The book is a police procedural mystery first, but one that  incorporates suspects and victims with unique abilities. Those abilities will stretch credibility with some readers while others will appreciate the creative means used to commit a crime.The book's strengths are its interesting premise and characters. Tony is complex and the author portrays his inner turmoil well. Carlos and his new partner Spinelli are also believable and likeable. Frequent references are made to events in the first book which have left an impact on characters in this installment, however, not enough backstory was provided to understand the complexity of the relationship between Tony and Lilith.

B008VIJNL0,"[1, 2]",3,"The blurb led me to believe that this story would be primarily a romance. It should be noted that this is not the case. The romance between Richard and Carol takes place entirely between the lines. In fact, Richard doesn't have much page time and I wouldn't call him the main character.What this book is really about is a large Christian family living in Oregon during the western expansion. This novel and the characters within it are defined by their Christianity. As they face the ups and downs of life, they turn to prayer and scripture. Many of the characters are children (though I did struggle to nail down their ages), and the story frequently centers around the lessons they learn from their own errors and from their family, all leading to a greater understanding of the Bible.  As such, the novel relies heavily on direct quotes from scripture.  If you are looking for a story about a large loving family who regularly discuss and expand upon their Christian faith, than you will likely enjoy this novel.My issues with the book were mostly with the execution. Their are many characters and the POV switches continually. Some scenes jump from head to head to head with such rapidity and linger so briefly that I was left feeling confused and detached. The timeline is also confusing, as it jumps forward and backwards, and I was frequently unsure whether I was reading the present or a flashback/flashforward. With such a vast cast of characters and so much jumping around I found it hard to feel really immersed in the story. It seemed too stretched out and lacking in focus. I also stumbled over frequent grammatical issues and typos. An additional round of editing would serve this novel well.Despite all of this, the book does sustain a strong sense of morality and love, which will appeal to readers who seek parabolic fiction.","09 4, 2013",A34AFYDY8PXD9R,Meg,"Christian fiction with a lot of heart, but not always smooth reading",1378252800

B004SYA76Q,"[4, 4]",5,"You know how sometimes you read a book and you get so into it that you really feel like you're part of the character's lives? Then, when it's over, you actually miss them the way you would a good friend? Well, Between the Land and the Sea by Derrolyn Anderson was like that for me. I read the whole book in two sittings, and would have read it in one if I didn't have to pick my son up from the bus stop. I just didn't want to stop reading!The story is about Marina, an intelligent 16-year old who has spent her life learning from tutors or teaching herself as she traveled the world with her father, a brilliant man that develops agricultural techniques to help save starving nations. Marina never stepped foot in a real school, but now that her father is traveling to Afghanistan, he feels it's best she stay with her aunt and at least try out a normal teenage life. But life in Aptos, Ca. is far from normal. Marina feels like she's come home again the moment she steps foot in her aunt Abby's house, and soon discovers that she has more of a connection to the place than she ever thought possible. Marina discovers new friends, new love, and new beings she never thought could exist, as well as a few shocking secrets about herself.This book had so many great qualities, I don't quite know where to start. First, the plot- I've never really read mermaid fiction before, so it was completely original to me. Beyond that, it was smoothly executed throughout the pages, never moving too fast or too slow. Every detail was revealed at precisely the right time in a wavelike rhythm not unlike the titular sea.  Second- the writing was absolutely flawless, with the exception of one or two typos. Considering that I've read huge names that have more typos than this, I'd say that's some pretty excellent editing! The dialogue was natural and the descriptions (especially of the clothes) were luscious.Third, and most notable, were the characters. Every single one, from the main character Marina to the bit players like the mean girls and the surfers, were so well-drawn that they could have walked off the pages and into my living room, and I would have recognized them in an instant. Marina's ""aunt"" Evie was, as the author described her, a ""real life Auntie Mame,"" and how I wish she was my fake aunt! Cruz' passion for fashion and Megan's melodious voice came through brilliantly. Aunt Abby was sweet and gentle, Shayla a bruiser bully with an extremely well-hidden soft underside.The love story between Marina and Ethan developed slowly, which I liked. It wasn't an instant ""oh, I love you, I need you, I can't live without you"" that tends to drive me batty. It was realistic and innocent.This is the first book in  Marina's Tales, and it was mostly about a  journey of discovery. I've already started the second one, and I'll review that as well when I finish it, but so far it seems to be more about the conflict that arose from the result of this book's journey. If you enjoy YA fantasy, strong characters, and great writing, you will enjoy Between the Land and the Sea.","05 12, 2011",A1BOATOHPT7EG8,Nikki,"Stunning descriptions, clean writing, and rich characters.",1305158400

B00GO3H88Y,"[1, 2]",4,"First thing that struck me about this book was the title &#8211; &#8216;Done with Men&#8217;. It is brilliant and perfect. Kairavi (kay) is a travel journalist who is down in the dumps, thanks to her unfortunate choice of boyfriends. After dumping her latest, she heads out to Goa on an assignment, meets her ex there and tries to experiment with her sexuality that ends in a accident.At the hospital, she meets the hot doctor Vivian, to whom she is instantly attracted.  With her best friend Baani and her boyfriend Kapil, giving her instant advice, caution and the pesky thought bubble, Kay spirals into yet another adventure of love.I loved the easy lucid style of Suchi&#8217;s language. It reminded me of one of my favourite authors, Sophie Kinsella. Done with Men has the same tempo, easy descriptions and fantastic humour that characterizes Shopoholic series and other books written by Sophie.A special mention must be made about the inconvenient truths that the &#8216;thought bubble&#8217; comes up with. Very very funny and original.Plus Points &#8211; Humorous breezy style of writing. Very funny moments, plots and light romanceMinus Points &#8211; Felt that there was scope for a bigger novel here. Kay seems to fall in love (lust) with Vivian quite rapidly though she is supposedly recovering from her break up. There is definitely scope here for more funny escapades, twists and turns and disasters. Would love it, if Suchi can consider writing a series of these novels. It would be most welcome.Verdict &#8211; Perfect weekend read. You could also pick it up after you had a blazing row with your husband. Might bring the man to heel faster than you thought.

B009FX204M,"[0, 0]",4,"You could say that I'm a long-time loyal reader of Christi Barth, I have read and enjoyed her latest 3 novels (Act Like We're in Love, Cruisin' Toward Love and Planning for Love), so I knew that any Christi Barth story would be a sweet romance. Combine that with a holiday setting and I couldn't resist the temptation! :-DAlthough Ask Her at Christmas featured one of my favourite tropes (the ""best friends to lovers"" trope with a bit of marriage of convenience thrown in) it failed to enchant me. Christi Barth's writing was wonderful, she has a way with words to paint the perfect holiday settings ;-) (you'll feel as if you were watching a holiday movie with her colourful and vivid descriptions of scenes and events), but despite the holiday ambiance permeating the story and truly adding the sprinkling of snow and bough of holly on top I couldn't love the romance since I had trouble connecting with the characters and understanding their motivations. Maybe it was because the hero and heroine were both so ready to forget about their love and give up their decade-long friendship or just because the characters didn't make much sense to me.On paper everything should have been perfect: Kyle the geeky yet drop dead gorgeous IT guy who has been best friends with unassuming, bestest of all friends Caitlin, who is ready to do whatever for him, even planning the most perfect and romantic proposal so the guy she has been in love with can ask his girlfriend to marry him. This setup right there was a bit unnatural, it took me some imagination to believe that Caitlin, despite being the best friend there could be would be so ready to help Kyle woo a woman for life when it would mean her eternal unhappiness. And their motivations behind their acts just left me baffled:Kyle is marrying a woman who is more of an escort to social events than a girlfriend to impress his father, and Caitlin is giving up his best friend and her love for him because she wants to help him obtain his father's approval.""I'm not going into this marriage to make googly-eyes and quote poetry. Monica and her precious hotel chain get perks if we marry, and I get my dad's respect.""Neither character won my approval. Despite being a grown up Kyle seemed way too quivering under his father's judgement and besides the very few allusions to convey that Kyle found Caitlin attractive there wasn't much to show he was in love with her or was worthy of her love.""Umm, because you're dating Kyle?""""We're not exclusive. He knows it. Kyle certainly doesn't sit home alone when I'm out of town.""Well, that was true. He'd racked up his fair share of hookups.It may be naive of me but when a heroine is celibate because she loves the hero I would expect quite the same from the hero...And the potential fianc&eacute;e was such a cardboard villainess it made me cringe. She was really awful. I understand that in a novella it would have been difficult to make her a more nuanced character but I still would have preferred to have her be a bit gray instead of the sharp black that she  and white  that Caitlin was.Pushing up into a half crouch with one hand on the table, Monica whipped out the other to encircle Caitlin's wrist. ""Listen carefully. You will take the job, you will leave Chicago, and you will cut Kyle out of your life.""Verdict: I still love Christi Barth's writing but despite its holiday setting and the wonderful holiday ambience that permeated this story, due to the characters I couldn't understand or like much, Ask Her at Christmas wasn't such a hit with me. Also at the end, while everyone knew a HEA was mandatory I still found the proposal superfluous and rushed. Sure, the hero's declaration of love was romantic and swoon-worthy, but I find it rushed to get married after one kiss and a decade of friendship, shouldn't they try dating first?Once again Christi Barth delivers a picturesque romance with flowing writing and beautiful lines but I just couldn't understand or like the characters, so sorry Ask Her at Christmas, it's not you it's the characters.""You deserve a wife who belongs to you, body and soul. You deserve a lover in your marriage bed. Someone to be there in the middle of the night to chase the demons away. Someone who fires up your blood and stirs your passion. Someone who wants you, who needs you with every cell of her body.""I give Ask Her at Christmas 3.5 stars!Plot: 7/10Characters: 7/10Writing: 9/10Ending: 7/10Cover: 8/10","12 25, 2012",A1JVLHI56QJF5V,Stella (Ex Libris),A picturesque holiday romance!,1356393600

Drake and his crew are captured by the prisoners, who are led by a woman named Queenie. He recognizes her leadership ability and tries to convince her to help him fight the Calithians and save Earth.Silly me. I don&#8217;t know what made me think this was going to be a sci-fi romance. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s an action adventure sci-fi novel with just a hint of romance. The focus of the story is not on the relationship between Drake and Queenie, but on gearing up to battle the Calithians. It is filled with fighting, malfunctioning spaceships, and explosions. Queenie defines the term kick-ass heroine, and I liked that she was Hispanic. I think the author tried to create two dominant main characters, but Queenie struck me as the more dominant one.If you want an explosion filled sci-fi novel, this is good pick.

And they set her up with couple of dates. What choice will she make? Who will she choose?After reading Sign of Times, I fell in love with Susan Buchanan's writing. So when she offered me her next novel in exchange for an honest review, of course I said ""yes"".The story follows Gill through her matchmaking ups and downs. Some of them are so funny, some of them so romantic, some so disastrous. I really loved Gill's character. She is workaholic, divorced, disappointed in love from previous relationships, but dreamer and believer that there is someone somewhere who is the right for her. She is also great friend and great sister and aunt. I really enjoyed her journey to find her Mr. Wonderful. Dating is not easy at all. Ending as a serial killer's victim is her best friends ` biggest concern, so they are always there for her , to save her and protect her. Her trip with them to Barcelona was very vividly described, and my memories from my journey there came back. Most of the characters were well developed, not just Gill, but also the men she dated.

As a reader who reads a little bit of everything, I have somehow not picked up a historical romance in quite some time.  This book was a quick read with very likeable characters.  The romance in this novel was balanced quite nicely with one the biggest mysteries of all time.Anna is studying to be a physician much to her mother's dismay.  While Anna's mother would like her to focus on finding a husband, she has given up on the possibility of marriage and has instead focused her energy on medical school.Drew has just been released from prison after being wrongly accused of committing the crimes of Jack the Ripper.  Anna's brother, Simon, asks Drew to work as an Inspector with Scotland Yard to help solve the crimes.  Drew agrees but Simon is quickly sent away leaving Drew to try to piece things together on his own.  Drew soon starts to depend on Anna's help on the case.  Drew and Anna are drawn to each other but Drew holds back because he feels he is not suited for a proper woman such as Anna.I did note that this is book two of a series.  I am sure that the first book covered events leading up to this book but this book is quite enjoyable on its own.  The characters in this book were fantastic.  Anna was strong willed and more than willing to go against the path society felt she should take.  Drew was a flawed man but also strong.  He worked hard in this book to make himself a better man.

A wonderful thoughtful sister but still -- Burke was going on vacation, at his sister's expense.  He had no input.  He had no idea where he was going or what to expect.  Imagine his surprise when he finds his destination is a gay resort!There is some light humor.  Burke's suitcase was planned from a female point of view and it included all new items, with price tags.  And itchy clothes.  So what Burke would have wanted to wear wasn't what his sister bought.  Classic example was green swim trunks while everyone else was in speedos or less.  The contrast was interesting.Some of names of where to eat. .. Strokes was one.  Very obvious symbolism for a gay resort and a bit off the top.  Food choices and other names were about as bad.  The resort name Cockatiel was just as bad.  Again, that's snarky humor.There were some hiccups between Staff and Burke, but no major angst simply due to page length.  They spend their vacation getting to know each other and hanging out, leaving the sexual romps until their last day.  The slow build up and taking their time to mesh was a nice change.There was more insight into Burke's character than Staff.  Obviously they hit it off and fortunately they live close enough to each other in the states, so their relationship will continue after their vacation.  It was a nice short little break, a palate cleanser of sorts, with an over the top gay beach resort.

B00JCJAK96,"[0, 0]",5,"This is the end of it, my friends. The finale. The big boom. The last book in the series. /sadface Before you venture further, before you click &#34;Read More&#34;, you should know that THIS is not a standalone novel. This brings it all together. This connects the dots. This is where it ends. You need to read up on the team, which means you need to read the novels previous.This was one of those books that you dread reading. You are dying to read it because you've read the whole series and you REALLY want the book, but you dread reading it, knowing that it means the series is over.I haven't read a book in a while that handles flashbacks in a seamless fashion. As Spencer is desperately trying to keep Veronica out of the shady side of his life, we get him reminiscing about their relationship. It is an incredible juxtaposition of their relationship then and their relationship now. You see this young, tough, sex on a stick man, hellbent on keeping his Ronnie out of harm's way even if it means she hates him forever, and then you see them just a year earlier romancing one another, lusting after one another, taking the utmost care. It's really incredible and gives such insight to this alpha male who has an ooey-gooey center.The reason why you need to read the other books in the series: While this is a spinoff, Rook &amp; Ronin's story introduced us to THE TEAM - Ronin the face, Ford the brains, Spencer the brawn. You learn what they do, what they did, and what is currently screwing up their lives. This is what Spencer is protecting Ronnie from; he doesn't want the taint to fall onto the innocent Bombshell who owns his heart.J.A. Huss has this knack for writing characters that make you as the reader REACT. You itch to bi*chslap some of them, you want to yell at some, you want to cuddle some, you want to kick them in the shins and tell them what's what. These characters POP off the page, so vividly that you are nearly ready to text them to tell them something.The action is constantly building, the mystery man will make your brow furrow, you will want to kick Spencer's shins in the very beginning for that schmuck move in the alley, but you know he has good intentions. (And he knows for sure that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and what makes him SO likable is that he's willing to sacrifice his own happiness and desires of being with Ronnie forever in order to make sure that she is healthy, safe, and happy. You have to admire that.) You'll get to the final action sequence and say, son of a gun, that sneaky jerk!I recommend this entire series. It is smart, sexy, and full of action and twists. Characters have personalities that are totally formed by their backgrounds and experiences making them multi-dimensional and realistic as you see them struggle to not be so controlling, or so protective, or to get over themselves. The action is intense, the sex between the couples is explosive, and things definitely go BOOM.Oh...and that second epilogue? Killer.

It was the story itself that made no sense at all. I had been waiting for this book because I really enjoyed parts 1&2 but this one was all over the place. Nya's character was weak, confused and borderline crazy and so was her relationship with Sacario. One minute they couldn't live without each other next minute they hated each other. I mean literally one minute Sacario is choking her out and she hates him and a few seconds later they are all kissy face. Then Sacario was arrested twice and sentence to 20 yrs in prison but as soon as he felt like it he could have his cop brother Ali or his sidechick attorney Olivia get him a get out of jail free card. Then Ali all through the book lusting for his brother's wife (Nya) and getting caught in compromising position with her several times. Let's not forget about Dinero and Kym. She was stealing kilos of coke from Nero to give to her ex Twan who is not only raping her in her home she shares with Dinero but he also have her doing drugs. Dinero and Killer Cari are suppose to be so tough but both of their women are being raped in their very own homes and they are non the wiser. I've probably said too much already but believe I could go on and on.

A shape-shifting dragon trying to build a sanctuary disguised as a luxury casino for his dwindling race in the heart of Vegas. These are the things a decadently delightful category romance with paranormal elements is made of. If you've ever wanted to read a wickedly good paranormal romance set against the backdrop of Sin City look no further.I can admit I never quite liked Alec because I felt like he was pretty closed off but Lucy makes up for his mystery by being a heroine you can get behind. Lucy is one tough cookie in a really rotten situation. Anyone who has a sibling that's good at getting themselves into trouble and then needing rescue will really want to see if she can pull it off. But it's hard stealing from someone who you're developing feelings for and Lucy's not happy that she's stuck bailing her brother out yet again.While LUCK OF THE DRAGON is category length there's a lot of story packed in and I was really excited by the world that Scott has built for the series. The secondary characters pepper the plot with just enough face time to make you want more and the villain is dastardly enough to make escaping his grasp satisfying.This is just one of those perfect reads for a weekend in if you love a glitzy setting, intense danger, scorching love scenes, and a fated mates romance that'll leave you craving more!Notes: ARC received via publisher.","07 28, 2013",A277TO3PKKNYDH,"Rhianna Walker ""The geek mom and book blogger...",Stop dragon your feet and buy this one!,1374969600

B00JOLCK3Q,"[0, 0]",4,"Okay&#8230; so now that I am breathing again, I think I can write a review of this book. Well, maybe&#8230; the ending nearly did me in. I have never been so hurt by the ending of a book, but it was worth every emotional scar it has left on my heart. This book was&#8230;wow.Karly has pretty deep emotional and physical scars that cut deep. They were left there by her parents. Though she could never truly understand why things in her life happened as they did, she knows beyond a doubt that they are still her parents and she will always love them. But she left that girl far behind when she left Boston. She is determined to prove that her past is not an indication of her future. She is starting her life, her way. She is strong and she is determined, but she will always have this shadow of doubt surrounding her heart that those she loves the most will leave her. It has happened to everyone she loves: her parents, her first love, her second love. This girl has had enough emotional trauma to last a lifetime. This is her turn to shine and to become something great.Only one problem with that, she doesn&#8217;t know what she is going to do now that she has moved. She hasn&#8217;t heard back on any of the teaching positions she has applied for despite her grades and the recommendations she has received. She knows it&#8217;s time to move on and that is what she is going to do. She moves in with her best friend Alexis after she completes her schooling and it is time to start a new life. What she doesn&#8217;t really expect is for Alexis&#8217;s brother and his daughter to walk into her life, changing everything.Nicholas has his own issues and his own drama and right now his world is focused solely on his little girl, Emma. So when he gets back to town and stays with his sister until his new place is ready for Emma and him, he meets her. Suddenly Nicholas is in a situation he never bargained for. There she is, Karley. She is smart, beautiful and she is amazing with Emma. But there is no way Nicholas could ever let her into his life. He had his shot at happily ever after. She walked away from him and Emma to start her life again. She didn&#8217;t want the family, she didn&#8217;t want the marriage. And though the two of them tried, she was just not made for it. The loss was devistating for Nicholas and there is no way he would ever put himself in that position again. Until he saw Karley.This book was full of highs and lows. Karley&#8217;s tragic past has left scars that you just cannot fathom. Nicholas has is little girl and is perfectly content to make her life perfect. What they didn&#8217;t expect was the attraction and pull they had to one another. The two of them had the passion and the charisma and the making of everything good. But the two of them both had a lot of fear. Neither knowing what the right thing to do was, but the attraction was there. There was a spark of electricity between the two of them.But of course, nothing can be that perfect right? What happens if Jamie, Nicholas&#8217;s ex, walks back into the picture? Or what if Karley&#8217;s first love shows up in town? Oh my, this book just kept me on my toes and just when I thought there was nothing else that could possibly happen to these two, I was hit upside the head with a two-by-four and my heart was shattered.This book will leaving you craving and wanting and hoping. It will leave you broken, betrayed and angry. This book will touch every emotional hot spot in your system and will keep at it until you are begging for more.

B004AM59T6,"[0, 0]",4,"Actual Rating is 3.5 StarsMy Initial Reaction&#8230;I&#8217;ve had so many Felicity Heaton books on my TBR for such a long time, so when I saw this short holiday novella I decided it was time. I really really enjoyed it and will definitely be making my way to her other books as soon as possible.The Characters&#8230;For a novella, the characters in Vampire for Christmas, were remarkably well developed. Shannon and Rafe both work for the Agency hunting down demons and vampires and the like. Shannon had an encounter in her past, which unfolds for us as the story progresses, that made her want vengeance. Working for the Agency just made sense. Rafe is her vampire partner. And after two years working together, he&#8217;s in love with Shannon. If she&#8217;s honest with herself, she loves him too. But she&#8217;s too scared to love a vampire after what happened to her, and the big question is &#8211; will she let down her defenses before it&#8217;s too late?I enjoyed the relationship between Rafe and Shannon &#8211; it felt natural and not forced at all. Felicity did a good job making me believe that these two characters had a long history that I believed, even though I didn&#8217;t actually get to see it. That&#8217;s so important for me, because I really don&#8217;t go for insta-love and was thrilled that this didn&#8217;t even feel like it. As for their background stories, they were developed well, but I really didn&#8217;t find myself caring too much. I knew that Shannon had something bad happen to her, but I really didn&#8217;t care if I ever found out. I guess I wasn&#8217;t invested in the characters at that level. That was fine though, because I cared about them in their present and the back story only served to make the present a little more complicated.The Story&#8230;Technically Vampire for Christmas has a plot besides the romance between Rafe and Shannon. Their work for the agency has them fighting some goo demon. I frequently forgot that the demon was part of the story and found it more funny than scary or something to be worried about. He flew slime at them&#8230; slime that seemed to be nothing more than gross. So there was never any anxiety or feelings of danger on my part. It was neat to see Shannon holding her own, to an extent, with the demon and Rafe though. I did find myself wondering how these two had survived for two years, considering the trouble they were having fighting off this laughable goo demon.The real story in Vampire for Christmas is the relationship between Shannon and Rafe. And that was very well-written and enjoyable (as I&#8217;ve already suggested above). Felicity is very good at creating a believable relationship and sexual tension is so few pages. And when she gets to the good stuff&#8230; it&#8217;s oh so good! Hot, sexy, steamy!I have to say I was a little disappointed by how small a part Christmas played in the story, since I did pick it up as a holiday read. It&#8217;s part of the story, yes. But it could have easily been left out and the story wouldn&#8217;t have been changed at all. So it was a backdrop of little importance and that made me a little sad. Oh well, I still enjoyed the novella.Concluding Sentiments&#8230;Vampire for Christmas is fun, sexy paranormal romance.

Shayla's love of her grandmother's tales inspires her to study anthropology and become an expert in ancient fertility cults of the Middle East.  While on a dig, her assistants discover several sexually explicit statues.Shortly after the discovery of the statues, Shayla finds herself swept away into the time of the past.  She discovers she is Queen Sheba who is about to go meet her future husband.Shayla's carriban is attacked and she finds herself separated from her people and lost in the vast desert.  A handsome sultan of an oasis rescues her and takes her to the safety of his home.  While the sultan is more than willing to protect Shayla, he does not tolerate her modern ways.  Shayla must quickly learn to cope within a male dominated society.  She must also discover a way back to her people and her thrown.The struggle between Shayla and the sultan is heart warming.  I enjoyed watching their relationship change and grow.  There was a mental chemistry as well as a chemical chemistry between the two that kept the story really interesting and challenged both Shayla and the sultan.I PERSONALLY despise it when men are drawn to one woman but have sex with other women.  This is the reason the book is earning 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  This is personally something I believe is lacking in many of our alpha male heroes and would love to see improve.The ending still has me wondering, questioning and thinking about the book.  I truly hope Kallista Dane writes a sequel to this story.I highly recommend this story, especially for anyone who enjoyed Susan Donovan and Celeste Bradley's Unbound which was formerly titled A Courtesan's Guide to Getting Your Man.  Both stories share a strong educated heroine, with captivating sneaks into past cultures, and enduring love stories.","04 19, 2014",A1I8RRV0ROXGMV,Mel,An enduring love story with a strong educated heroine and sneaks into the past.,1397865600

B0084FGX36,"[0, 0]",5,"Fashioning a Romance is a swoon-inducing read that will hit the sweet spot of any romantic. When the story begins, American Caitlyn Taylor has scored a dream gig as fashion designer-in-residence for posh British socialite Sophie Harrington. Sophie is a kind and generous boss who really appreciates Caitlyn and thinks of her as a friend (Thank you to the author for not making this character a sterotypically abusive diva!) Grateful for her good fortune, Caitlyn has an all work/no play mentality. She just wants to create beautiful garments and leave all the club-hopping and man-chasing to Sophie. That is until she meets Sophie's handsome charmer of a brother, John.An incorrigible flirt and infamous womanizer, John wastes no time in putting some of his well-practiced moves on Caitlyn. Although she can't deny that there's chemistry between them, Caitlyn has no interest in being another notch on John's bedpost (Girlfriend has some serious trust issues with men thanks to her oft-married father.) John is baffled by Caitlyn's seeming indifference, but he refuses to give up, getting sneaky and tricking her into a romantic getaway with him. Can Caitlyn continue to resist John when he woos her in the City of Light? No spoilers here, but I want to commend Ms. Mercer for bringing Paris, its wonderful sights, and its beautiful ambiance to life on the page. I have now added ""Have a romantic picnic in the Rodin Museum's Sculpture Garden"" to my bucket list!A few of my favorite things about this book - 1) I loved that there was a measuring tape in the header for each new scene. It was a cute and clever reminder that the heroine was a fashion designer. 2) The author did a great job of describing the intricacies of Caitlyn's craft without being too ponderous about it. Clearly, she's well-versed on the subject of design, and it showed. 3) Sophie wasn't in that many scenes in the book, but she certainly made her presence known. The character was so effervescent and entertaining; I'd love to read a sequel to Fashioning a Romance, starring Ms. Sophie! 4) I adore a good epilogue, and the one in this book was first-rate. Written from the POV of a snarky society columnist, the epilogue was more biting than the rest of the book and it was fun to see all the characters through the eyes of an outsider. There was a line in the epilogue that made me laugh so hard I choked on my Diet Coke!In summation, Fashioning a Romance is a delightful romp that I would recommend to anyone looking for an engaging, romantic read. I am definitely adding Ms. Mercer's second novel, Unmasking Maya, to my TBR pile!","01 6, 2013",A2YYMPNDY7GTP5,BrainyBlonde,A Delectable Bonbon of a Book!,1357430400

B0031Y6BFA,"[1, 1]",5,"From the moment I picked up the book I was hooked! Heather Killough-Walden has the rare ability to transform seemingly mundane scenes into moments of pure suspense and intrigue. I was so entranced by the relationship between Jack Thane and Annabelle Drake from that very first scene that I kept reading through the night till dawns early light when I finally finished the book and it was one hell of a ride.In order to truly enjoy the book it is best to appreciate it as a work of fantasy and just enjoy the ride. Those with puritanical views that are looking for a moral lesson should probably skip this one and head somewhere else. Now in real life my views may be a little on the puritan side but I enjoy my fantasy deep and dark so this book was definitely up my alley and Heather Killough-Walden delivered in spades. Her character development is wonderful and it was a breath of fresh air to discover the flaws built into the characters instead of the usual cookie cutter characters so often viewed elsewhere.The themes in this book are mature and there is a good smattering of adult language but other than that the book is clean. Much to the consternation of some of the reviews I have read. Usually I would be one of those as I hate a tease but I never felt a loss at the lack of a full on intimate scene. The book was too enjoyable and there was plenty of substance that held my attention and the intimacy between the characters transcended anything a mere sex scene could portray.If you enjoy strong female characters, dark and dangerous men and sleek and powerful motorcycles then this book is for you. I give this book 5 out of 5. If I was concerned about the miniscule editing issues I noticed I might drop down to a 4.5 but this book was a Dollar and for that the author has given me an amazing experience that definitely deserves this 5.","05 14, 2011",A2Y9I5YFW746UQ,Cali Girl Reviews,Fast and Furious and I loved every minute of it!!!,1305331200

They spend more and more time together and become more invested in each other when Travis learns he must transfer or lose his job.

It was a fun read with some great moments, some that I would have liked to see built up more than those that were. It would be nice to see another book about the 2 of that now that the tour is over.  Book 2 in the series is about Anna, one of Lacey's roommates... Fake It.

B00DP121BC,"[1, 1]",4,"There is nothing that I love more than a plus-size heroine finding her HEA with a sexy man!  In Lust Eternal, the sexy man is Keeshan, a victim to a curse that's put him inside of a lamp.  He's spent years pleasuring the women who find the lamp, developing feelings for them, and then being left heart broken when they leave.  He's desperate to find an end to the curse when the plus-size heroine of his dreams, Aimalee, finds her way to him.  He has no problem pleasuring her and enjoying her company.  He can't seem to get enough of her.  He knows she's going to leave like everyone else, so he's going to give it his all and enjoy what time he has with her.  And boy, does he give it his all!Lust Eternal has everything an erotic romance should have - sexy male, detailed steamy sex scenes and a sweet romance that gives the book heart.  The story of Aimalee and Keeshan is what I would consider an adult version of the whole genie in a lamp bit, adding a deeper layer of emotion and eroticism.  My favorite thing about this book is the way Keeshan worships Aimalee's curves.  As a woman with curves, it's so nice to read something that celebrates us and it makes it so much easier to relate and enjoy.  The pacing of the book is nicely done, making it a quick and enjoyable read as well.book provided by the publisher for the purpose of an honest reviewreviewed by Marie","07 29, 2013",A2FSWI7Q6MZ9PX,"Vanessa ""The Jeep Diva""",Lust Eternal,1375056000

TorrensEmily Matthews is a young woman who is very devoted to her work at a charitable organization that raises funds to help wounded soldiers as they return from the battlefield. Some are amputees...but all of the survivors who benefit from her organization have been scarred one way or the other, whether physically or emotionally. The effects of war and the negative consequences are near and dear to Emily's heart.  She lost the love of her life, Robby, to the war in Afghanistan and after two long and lonely years, she still mourns his loving absence from her life. Now Emily is reluctant to ever fall in love again and is determined to close her heart to such a possibility.  Every year she spends time in the much loved poppy field near her home where she relives one of her fondest memories of better times with Robby.James Harrison, on the other hand, is in his late twenties and a former rifleman who experienced three tours of duty in Afghanistan. He returns to the UK after being injured in battle and receives new training as a physiotherapist. He is also a man whose heart has been broken. James has been in a previous serious relationship with long time girlfriend, Naomi, who decided she no longer wanted to live in Benton Cross. She subsequently leaves to pursue a career in London and James is emotionally crushed when they go their separate ways.  He is determined to immerse himself in his work as he caters to the wounded survivors of war. However, in a local bookstore as he peeks up between the shelves of books, he is intrigued and captivated by the most incredible eyes looking back at him...From then on, an enticing love story ensues between these two very reticent and awe struck individuals. Of course, they certainly meet their fair share of challenges which readily entice the reader as their relationship unfolds...Author D.G. Torrens is fast becoming a seasoned author with several well-written novels now published. I have had the honor of reading and reviewing two others and ""The Poppy Fields"" is another crowd pleaser with its many unpredictable twists and turns. I truly enjoy a good love story and this one certainly fits the bill. There are plenty of historical facts and medical data included to spice up the story line and give this fictional novel the required authenticity. There is a cliff hanger at the end of this easy-to-read romantic novel, therefore, I know there is more ""good stuff"" to come!

B00CC68QCY,"[0, 0]",4,"4.5 StarsI've been sold on author Tamara Morgan since the very first book I read by her and each time I read her I'm more and more enthralled. It's hard to even explain why I enjoy her work so much but I'll try. I like that she goes out of her way to weave stories, I love that she chooses often different occupations or hobbies for her characters, and I admire the way she makes her characters own up to their issues and shortcomings. She never gives them an out; they have to figure it out and ""man-up"" to get where they want to be. The Derby Girl is no different and for that I am extremely thankful.When Jared Fine came on the scene in the first book of this series, Rebound Girl, I'll admit I really kind of hate him. Mostly for his past sins but also for his arrogant, self serving attitude. So, I really wondered if I'd enjoy his story at all because honestly I didn't think he was worthy of anyone. Can I just say that he met his match and more in Gretchen? I freakin' love, love strong and sassy heroines and that describes Gretchen in spades. I love that when Jared first met her he saw her not at her best and he was still completely and totally enamored. Yes, he was completely clueless and didn't know her from his regular morning breakfast stop (I told you he was self centered) and of course her body art intrigued him, but the fact that he wanted to protect and help her showed he too had a better side, a side most people never see. I liked that she called him on his crap and wouldn't let him get away with bad behavior. I loved that she made him see what a complete and total prick he could be to people something I really don't think he had a clue he did on a regular basis. Yes, he said he wasn't a good person and he warned her that he wasn't the hero everyone made him out to be but she saw past that and understood the complex and the many different sides there are to Jared.Honestly on paper these two seem so mismatched. He's a respected humanitarian and world renowned plastic surgeon and she's a part time barista, part time life guard, and a serial student. He's all tuxedos and country club and she's all corsets and roller derby. But in reality they are well suited and in addition their heat is off the charts. I love that they end up going at it in some interesting places because they just simply can't wait another minute. But, I hate that neither one is honest about their feeling for each other causing all kinds of issues and insecurities especially when Jared is courted for a dream job.While their relationship is at the forefront of this book, both Jared and Gretchen are dealing with family issues and Jared's partners including his ex Whitney and her new boyfriend have firmly planted themselves in the middle of their relationship further pushing Jared's buttons and filling Gretchen with all kinds of tales. I love seeing the characters from the first book and it makes me wonder what's up next for this charming and fun series.With a completely fresh plot, witty and entertaining dialog, hot sexy encounters, characters who have something to prove to themselves, and dynamic writing The Derby Girl is a must read for romance lovers and an excellent addition to an already strong series.Review copy provided for an honest review.","08 27, 2013",A3LXRIY0HE71K,"Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews ""Guilty Pleasur...","Fresh, witty and sexy...",1377561600

My favorite aspect of this book is the author&#8217;s exquisite descriptions of the electric energy between Rachel and her love interest (no spoilers here!). You can literally feel the crackling between the main characters; their attraction to each other is so real and so strong, it transcends the limitations of the page and fills the room. The author did a very nice job of creating a romance that is so hot, so steamy, and so descriptive; it is a stellar recounting of a love that surpasses everything that has become mundane about today&#8217;s works of romantic fiction.I simply refuse to ruin the ending of this novella for you. It will have to suffice to say that the ending is so packed full of surprise that this book will haunt you long after you&#8217;ve finished the last page.

It put my mind at ease when I knew there wasn't anything really freaky going on with aliens in this story. Just the normal stuff that goes on in an erotic story: a lot of mental foreplay and sex. Ok, there was a little part about a tail, but it didn't get too strange...and hey, that might be a normal thing on another planet.This was a good short read. I'd even read it if the erotic parts were cut. I wouldn't mind learning about the alien race a bit more and their background. If could have used a little longer of an erotic scene, even. That might have drawn my attention away from the story elements and focus on what the story really is about: hot human/alien action.Another pleasing story from Parkerson.

The strength she had, despite being a small, shy woman, as she woke up to find herself naked and chained to a cot in a strange, dark room. She didnt scream and despair, she didnt panic. She held herself together long enough to discover that there was a hidden light in the darkness.Aaron was a man lost. Lost in his own darkness. Lost in the life of crime that was forced on him by his father. You could see that he was fighting the life that he had been dealt. Like another Aaron, his father sought to corrupt him, and although he reveled in the control and violence of his position in his father's organization, he had limits. Lines he refused to cross. He wouldnt let his soul be wholly lost.Aaron has never brought a woman that he could care about into his life, knowing how he would corrupt her. Knowing how his father would use her against him. But, when Aaron shows special interest in the beautiful concert cellist Madeleine Clark, he unwillingly gives his father the tool to control and destroy him. But what his father didnt know, was that by bringing Madeleine and Aaron together, he had also given them both a reason to fight, to face down death and become lions.The writing and dialogue in this book is beautiful, but you should be warned of the darkness you will find. It is full of abuse, inhumane degradation, and violence; but above all, the strength of the human spirit and enduring love. But the violence did almost overshadow the beauty of this story near the end. It is the reason for the missing half a star. I'm talking about graphic disembowelment, dismemberment, and beheadings. I knew to expect more violence for the climax of the story, but I didn't expect it to be that strong. It was much more than I would have wanted, or what I was comfortable with and it really turned me off for a few moments. But before that I was convinced it was going to be a 5-star book. I still feel like it deserves a 5-star rating rather than 4-star though.A bonus point for this book, is that the scene on the cover actually did happen. Its rare that they have such exact representations on book covers. I highly recommend this book for fans of dark and intense romance.

I loved getting a sense of when the attraction started before the other character even realized.I could relate to Kyle the most-we're both 30, both bah humbug when it comes to holidays, both writers. I thought it was sad that he lost his mom on Christmas Eve and Lexi was an orphan. Through her pain of a divorce and no family except her kids, Lexi managed to help Kyle host a family get together at his home. I was touched by the scene when everyone is in his living room discussing what they miss most about the mom.I loved that even though it was clear to the readers that they both liked each other, Lexi and Kyle were both insecure about how the other person felt. It reminded me of crushing on someone in junior high. The plot thickened when Kenneth (Kyle's brother) made a move on Lexi; apparently he was the ladies man.My favorite moments were whenever Lexi, her two kids, and Kyle hung out. The kids were in awe because he was a celebrity to them. Their favorite books were the Jared Strong ones. The story was definitely cute and funny-I love witty humor.I RECOMMEND this book to read.","12 26, 2012",A158ZKOYSB5FTD,Yawatta Hosby,"Yawatta Hosby's review on ""Bah, Humbug!""",1356480000

B00ICTUW6I,"[1, 1]",3,"When They Weren&#8217;t Looking (Book 3). Zoe YorkReview from Jeannie Zelos Book Reviews.Book three of the Wardham series, but as each book is a standalone and complete, it didn't matter that I hadn't read earlier ones, though possibly there were small things I missed, connections etc from not knowing the characters.Still, it was easy to pick up and follow the story. Its a sweet romance, the unexpected consequences of a hot and sexy, and for Evie, very unusual one night stand. She doesn't have any info on Liam though other than the basics, so telling him he's to be a dad is going to be hard. Luckily he turns up in the town where she lives, and he's delighted. He wants to dive in and be part of Evie's life, but after two failed relationships, and with two young sons to look after she's very cautious. Add to that he's a few years younger and ...she's running scared. Liam's a gem though, not easily put off, not going to abandon her and his child and gradually he insinuated himself into her life. I loved him, a really genuine, kind and loving man. He'd had a difficult family relationship, and wanted more for his child than he had from his upbringing. Evie, she was sweet, loved her boys but was really conscious of the slurs on her character her ex had thrown around. She knew once he met Liam she'd face taunts about his age. Its easy to say the only opinions that matter are our own, but hard in practice to make that work, and Evie was always running an internal monologue about what she should do/had done and what she ought to have done instead. It left her with little self confidence, and yet she was an excellent mum and support to her kids.Its a sweet story, lovely character,s including his and her friends, a little gentle drama, but for me it was just a bit too soft and sweet. I needed a bit more highs and lows, anger and happiness, tears and laughter. Still, as I&#8217;m always saying that's just my view, and there are other readers that adore this kind of gentle romance. Its well written, had parts that pull at emotions at times, especially those lovely boys of hers and how they try to look after her sometimes :)At the moment is on offer at just 77p for 252 pages, so a bargain if you like this small town, gentle romance type of story.Stars: Three, a good book just not enough drama for me to rate it higher.","02 12, 2014",A1X2URS71RRMMF,"Jeannie Zelos ""jeanie zelos book reviews""","sweet, gentle small town romance",1392163200

Although it commences in early 20th century England (approx. 1920) and moves to events of 1940 during the Nazi blitz of London, for me the book really got underway with the contemporary story of eighteen-year-old Christopher Ross of Golden, Colorado, a boy who finds computers and drafting simple as pie, yet with his dyslexia struggles to read. Christopher is a solitary with a special talent: tritely put, he is a ""human lie detector."" He can read what an individual is actually thinking, while he or she is speaking something else.Lately Christopher has been mentally plagued by an entity named James, who is deceased but yet not a ghost. James is purely evil, but his mentor V is much worse. Then Christopher's life is uprighted when another ""Other,"" Ellie, appears-it is she who was born in 1920, concealed from an evil society by her uncle Edward, who was himself a seer, and died in 1940, just before her eighteenth birthday. As an Empath, she has spent her life-and afterlife-helping others. Now as she discovers Christopher, she and he both fall unwillingly in love.Author Elyse Draper has a lyrical and poetic imagination and brings the many locales to vivid reality. Her view of afterlife is also unusual, but logical (if it's appropriate to call spirit entities a logical progression). The rollercoaster ups and downs of emotions Ellie, Christopher, and the secondary characters go through is easily comprehensible, and more than one tear will be brought to readers' eyes.  Christopher certainly is in line for becoming one of the higher pantheon of young male protagonists.","09 13, 2012",A81S2CYRRJGHI,"Mallory Anne-Marie Forbes Haws ""Fair and auth...","Unusual, Poetic, Vivid Metaphysical",1347494400

He is going on tour with Sadie Blake, the other half of Blackened Sunrise. Jaxson is nursing a broken heart over how things were left between himself and Gracie. He also wants to pursue his solo career, if he can only get out of his contract with Sadie.Jaxson and Sadie don't really have a conventional relationship. As they embark on the tour, it is obvious that the sexual chemistry is still there, but is the heart still in it? Sadie can still make Jaxson respond physically, and Jaxson knows exactly what buttons to push to get Sadie hot and bothered.I will be honest, Jaxson was not my favorite person in Beautiful Strangers, but his cocky ass really did grow on me with Blackened Heart. You can't help but fall just a little bit in love with him. He's hot, and he knows it. He's not ashamed to admit it.Sadie is another story. She has been holding Jaxson in a contract to Blackened Sunrise and a marriage. Jaxson has hurt her in the past, just as she has hurt him. She is sassy and feisty.Glenna Maynard has really written an amazing companion novella to her debut novel, Beautiful Strangers. Blackened Heart was sexy and funny.

B006OTXNW8,"[2, 3]",3,"Previously I've read My Pet Dragon by the same author, like with that book the illustrations are in another league above the simple story that accompanies them and the reason for purchasing the book.  Pigtastic isn't as long as My Pet Dragon, I was expecting it to have a bit more content.  Basically it's an anti depression, maybe at the result of bullying keep your chin up, think positive tale. A pig talks to the reader about when it feels down, it remembers it's pigtastic and everything is great again.  A great message for sure, but the majority of the text has the pig working out (as in exercising) and not changing, as in well that's why I'm fat, but oh well that's me there isn't anything I can do about it. This isn't going to be the case if an obese child who is being made fun of and is depressed was given opportunities and support to exercise in real life. It's just the wrong message in a world where a lot of people look for excuses or have an its not my fault attitude to various things not just being overweight, it's just the wrong message to pass on to the next generation.  It would have been a better story if the pig wasn't exercising if the point was to except everyone for how they look. Maybe the text could have focused on its big nose which the pig can't change or something like this.Again though the illustrations are brilliant which bring the book up overall in my rating.  Like with My Pet Dragon I could easily see physical copies of this book being marketed with a bonus little toy figure of the pig and selling well.","03 8, 2012",AIO247KHD2O40,James N Simpson,"Great Computer Still Illustrations, Has a Positive Message for Kids, Well Sort of",1331164800

B00JAX58R8,"[1, 1]",5,"Written as a prequel, &#8216;Unforgettable You&#8217; goes back in time to tell the story of Jo Blaine, sister of 1950s time-warp, Amy Blaine, who featured brilliantly in Ms Penney&#8217;s debut novel, &#8216;Irrepressible You&#8217;. I loved &#8216;Irrepressible You&#8217; and was looking forward to this author&#8217;s second contemporary romance/chick lit novel. I was especially keen to see how a feisty oil-rig engineer tom-boy would be wooed by a mild mannered, marketing rain-man of a Margaret River vineyard. Once again I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.It&#8217;s difficult to outline the plot of &#8216;Unforgettable You&#8217; without giving away too much about both novels. It&#8217;s enough to say that both stories explore the lives of two sisters who experienced a childhood marred by domestic violence and yet whose life-responses couldn&#8217;t be more different from one another&#8217;s. In Amy we find an ultra-feminine kitten with nerves of steel who&#8217;s on an unconscious mission to avoid emotional intimacy. In Jo we find a volcanic wonder-woman on a mission to hide her inner softness and her conscious hankering to find just that. It takes the patient persistence of beta-hero good guy, Stephen Hardy, to finally break through Jo&#8217;s brittle front.This is another great story from Ms Penney. The writing is incredibly detailed, to the point where you can imagine everything going on in the scene, and yet the story telling never sags. The characters are so vivid they leap off the page. Their stories aren&#8217;t just told from the point of view of two protagonists looking lovingly into each other&#8217;s eyes, it&#8217;s told from within the dynamic network of the interwoven friendships surrounding the Blaine sisters. In some ways these books remind me of Richard Curtis&#8217; screen plays (Love Actually, Notting Hill etc) with the focus on a &#8216;family&#8217; of friends &#8211; all successful, talented, Gen-Ys of the business and artistic worlds, and yet all of them a bit lost in their own ways, searching for something more meaningful beyond material success.&#8216;Unforgettable You&#8217; tackles some very tough issues. Domestic violence and the way it affects the children involved, preventing them from realising their full potential in a myriad of ways, is not for the faint hearted amongst writers. I loved that &#8216;Unforgettable You&#8217; sensitively explored another dimension of this issue through a quite different sibling within an affected family. And I loved, of course, that the decent, deserving Stephen Hardy was the man to see through the protective smoke-screens to the real Jo Blaine. I highly recommend &#8216;Unforgettable You&#8217;.(I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review)","07 14, 2014",A3GOPUUTU9L1LW,Anna Clifton,Couldn't put it down!,1405296000

In The Summer of Wrath, Wilson is a no holds barred character in search of his sister, I don't blame him.

There was a fair amount of fighting and violence, but a minimal amount of sexual activity (and not really any club whoring around) compared to many MC books on the market. Instead this was a sweet story of a single mom who gets involved (way more than she ever wanted) when she helps a friend patch up some injured bikers and then becomes the object of desire of the President of the club. She tries to resist him, after all he lives a criminal life and she is the mom of two little kids, so of course she wants to keep away from him and all he represents. However, he slowly breaks down her walls and becomes very attached to not only this sexy woman but her adorable kids.This was a very different kind of biker book...yes, there is violence, drugs, guns, crooked cops and gang warfare...but it is also a story of two people from opposite worlds who find a common ground to meet and fall in love.Action packed and at times very playful and sexy.**** 4 **** &#34;you can call me daddy&#34; stars =)","06 1, 2014",A3W3XC01BFJJMR,Sue B.,Learning to love again...and become a new family,1401580800

Although I read the story in one sitting, it became predictable after a while, as I already mentioned in my review about Torrent. This was a bit of a disappointment, since I started it with a lot of enthusiasm. It just didn't meet my expectations...In spite of the predictability, Lisa T. Bergren managed to show the brutality of a medieval war. No modern medicine, no hygiene. Retribution that won't even spare children. And of course the medieval men and their view about woman. That's something that I find very annoying every time I read a historical roman. But o well, what can we do about it? It's something that's normal in that time. You can't cross time and space to make them see their wrongdoingsFurthermore I liked reading through the eyes of Lia. In the other books, where Gabi is the main character, I got to know her as a very agreeable girl. The real deal is something else! When the need arises she knows what to do and how to handle those chauvinistic medieval man. Loved it! ^^I also loved reading about the blooming romance between Luca and Lia. You could see the hints between them in the first three books, but now it's their time to shine! And they are such an adorable couple! They behave much more like two teenagers in love than Marcello and GabiMy conclusion: 3 hearts.

Manga is apparently not my genre and I stated that the book had been better and that I would need to reread it to purge my mind of the mess the Manga made of it.  So, unable to find my old edition I bought another and boy was I wrong.  Yes Manga is not my thing but the book was better in my memory than in actuality.  I didn't hate it, (I still like this combination of MC's) but it was severely lacking in editing and plot.  My only excuse for such a high rating the first time around, is it must have been a very early foray into the m/m genre and I was so caught up in the story (gay sex, that is) that I overlooked basic good taste.","02 10, 2014",A29GHC1EWRRF6T,Buffy,Re-read,1391990400

A chance meeting on a plane between sexy playboy Nicholas and Rebecca sets off a series of events in which fate keeps bringing them together. Rebecca is recovering from a breakup with her ex fiancee and Nicholas is everything on her &#34;run like hell&#34; list of qualities but life has other plans. She has come to New York to find herself and her dream job but will she find something more?I knew I was going to like Rebecca from the very first page, she is immediately shown to be feisty and strong which are two of my favorite qualities in a female character. She has her moments of insecurity like most women but she knows what she deserves and stands up for herself. This is a short novella so I didn't really get a good feel for Nicholas's character yet but so far he comes off like an arrogant playboy who feels as though he can just take whatever he wants. While the plot feels like a few novels I've read before and is sort of predictable it is still very well done.I feel that Rebecca's character is strong enough to make this plot stand out against other similar stories. I can't say too much without giving a spoiler but the last interaction between Rebecca and Nicholas in this volume was priceless, I laughed out loud while tempted to yell &#34;you go girl&#34;. I'm excited to see how their relationship is going to develop with their white hot chemistry considering there is a huge obstacle between them. It's obvious that once they get together the sex is going to be scorching and I can't wait, I just hope Rebecca's character stays strong and true to herself!REVIEWED BY JAYMEE O'NEIL PINDAR FOR SUMMER'S BOOK BLOG","07 9, 2014",A32EUN2MXY9FHT,Summer's Book Blog,LOVED IT,1404864000
B00AWFIJXS,"[0, 1]",5,"This book is really something different. A friend told me the hero of this story will stay with me, and she was right!I felt so much for Jason! He is such an unconventional hero. The way he dealt with the life he had to live was really admirable. There's a lot of self-hate, because really, he has no one to blame for except for himself. He couldn't shift the blame, he couldn't lash out at people. It was heartbreaking, but at the same time he is so strong. And he never embellishes what happened to him - he owns up to his own stupidity and I really respected him for it.This could have been just another in line of romance books - but Anna's character is what made it real. She's a smart woman, and she constantly questions whether or not being with Jason is a good idea - if she will be able to handle his disabilities, if they have a place in each other's lives, if they can deal with their very different lifestyles. I think it was very realistic, I know I would stop and think if I was in the same situation. It's what people do. And she has appropriate reactions to everything that happens in this book. And makes decisions that are right for her, rather than for Jason.Their relationship is strained in the beginning, neither of them knows what to do with the other - but there's awesome chemistry as well. I liked the romance so much, because it was so unique. You have this educated, ambitious woman, you know they strive to date in their social circles rather than a lowly brain damaged janitor, but the pull is just too strong between them. And the change both of them bring to each other's lives was just overwhelming.I did feel it was a bit of insta-love, though, so there.So the writing? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Reading Jason's POV, you really get that he has brain damage. His thought process, some of the things he does, the way he goes about his daily routine. I really applaud the author for this.I liked the supporting characters - grumpy Rob who turns out not to be so bad, Anna's parents who only make a short appearance but they're not horrible, they're just worried about their daughter, Jason's little sister who I absolutely loved. Just great. It's not that any of them were really important, but they all bring something good to the story.So, this is my first time reading a Bonnie Dee book, and I sort of expected things to get really steamy. There are a couple of graphic sex scenes in this book, but they're nothing you won't read in other contemporary romance.Overall, an unconventional love story with an unforgettable hero who gets a second chance at life and uses it, and a smart heroine that has her priorities set straight. Do I even have to recommend it after I said that? It was different. I really liked it.","03 20, 2013",A64B5ZZOU64IQ,Amazon Customer,Different and wonderful,1363737600

B00EDDBT9G,"[3, 4]",5,"This one is really good. The idea is fresh and very well executed. I could not stop reading once I started.I really like Austin and Cam. Their day to day painful struggles with the terrible memories of their 5 months plus incarceration by a psychopath was so well portrayed and heart wrenchingly real. It was easy to understand why these two needed the other to survive the horrendous memories. Each man only have the other while they were caged together. Only Austin could understand Cameron's pain and horror and vice versa. Noone else could. So it was easy to understand how the bond they forged while they were in captive was really something so much deeper.However I do have a little niggle. I could so understand the resulting love between these two guys. However could Austin so easily embraced the sexual part of it. On the other hand I am just nit-picking here as the writer did mention in a few sentences that Austin did appreciate beautiful men as he did beautiful women. So Austin was inherently bisexual. Maybe a convenience but hey this is MM romance.. Austin's marriage which had long ceased to work and a cold wife of course also helped Austin's case.I really love the growth in Austin's character as the story progressed. Austin used to be stoic, easy to please, against changes, just a simple man who does not ask for much to be content with life. His kidnapping, terrible as it may sound,  actually helped this character to grow, to be able to say no, to want more in life and take that extra step even if it was stepping out of his comfort zone. As for Cameron, revelation about his background made us realized how much harder it must have been for this character to have emerged from the ordeal still sane, much less be there for Austin. I love how one helped the other to deal with the pain and horror. At the end of the day it was so easy to root for these two to be together.As for the plot, I could only say that the flashbacks detailing their torment at the hand of the psychopath is brilliant writing. Suspenseful, riveting,  deeply emotional, bleak, heartbreaking, at times horrifying and painful to read. Yet I could not quit reading. I found myself helding my breath in nearly all the flashback scenes. Thankfully the writer interpersed the current story with the flashbacks, the flashbacks constant but short and therefore easier to read, a writing skill I appreciate.Ok so the last 20% of the story revert to the typical MM romance but hey after so much pain and suffering Austin and Cameron certainly deserve their happiness. This one seems to be only MM romance from this writer. Very glad there is a novella in progress of another victim and this time the writer could maybe tie up some loose ends. This one certainly deserves the no. 1 position in the gay romance list. Great read.","08 18, 2013",A1ARJBC8VD5P8P,R.Parklane,At last something different! Love it.,1376784000

The Unicorn has to be one of the top villians I have ever read about.

Their respect for one another, and for everyone they deal with, rings true and bright and should be honored.

I felt that it really added an extra layer to their love story. We drove head first into Velaney&#8217;s past, but Eric was still a mystery to us. Well in Burn the walls are knocked down. We creep into his past and face his demons head on. Its definitely a heart gripper though, so be prepared.Velaney.

I mean as if life hadn&#8217;t already thrown some real mountains in her way, more just keep popping up. These one though, they really test the strength of E&V;&#8217;s Love.

As you'll read in the introduction, the main character telling the story is Jhinn, the Wild Elf, who expertly becomes instantaneously likeable and relatable.You can't help but become emotionally connected and this helps direct and guide you through the twists and turns of this tragic yet exciting adventure. He manages to join forces with the humans on a joint adventure of protecting his wild home, the forest. Of course I'm sure their understanding and meaning behind it all was completely opposite.Jhinn meets his soulmate during this scenario, falls immediately in love and their journey continues. Taking you through ups in downs uncivilized, mirroring those in our world today.

(missing the comma after 'once')""From what he says their whole world uses advocates in their legal system."" (missing the comma after 'says')While I normally don't have a problem with the occasional missing comma, this book suffered the issue probably on average 1-3 times per page.Another common problem is the eliding of the term 'that' in important contexts.These kinds of problems create mental 'hiccups' while reading.  Effectively the reader's brain as to backtrack in order to re-parse sentences and figure out what is missing and where, soaking up a whole lot of time.I did make careful annotations of these errors (and there are a whole lot of them).

Just when you think you have a handle on the way things are going, there is a dramatic left turn that leaves you reeling and wanting more.The author takes a lot of risks in this book, which is refreshing. If you want a cookie cutter plot, stick with the other books in this genre. If you want something that will keep you engaged. Pick this one up.When you do, it will be very hard to put down. Each time I said, &#34;I'll read one more chapter,&#34; I ended up reading another and another.The structure of this book was also a risk, but one pulled off with expert precision. The book bounces back between chapters that take place post-catastrophe -- The Ejection in this case -- and flashback chapters that give the ready some background on how these well-crafted characters reached the place in their lives where they are now. In the hands of lesser writers, this would have been a muddled mess. But in this case, it was brilliant.Now, some will not like some of the plot twists. Some are quite jarring.

Not because of what was going on, but because of the ability of Nico to write them without turning off the reader. For those of you who are getting their feet wet in the romance genre, or for any genre for that matter, this book is textbook example on how to write sex without having drift into the NC-17/X realm that can turn off the average reader.Overall, the book was an enjoyable read and the action from beginning to end was non-stop. It didn't leave me breathless, but it definitely kept my interest until the very end, which for me, is a very good thing.

B00K4368KO,"[20, 32]",3,"I came in, after composing myself (or so I thought) and wrote a review for this book when I was utterly RAW.  In doing so, my review was not very objective.  It was also not very fair to the author.  I was not able to see past the ending and judged the book solely on the ending.  I even messaged the author.  Complete honesty here ;)  I received less than pleasant messages in response to my review from other readers and reviewers.  After conversing with the author via Facebook, the author brought it to my attention that what I wrote her in my detailed messages about the book was vastly different then my Amazon review and THAT should have been my review.  I re-read my detailed messages about the book to the author and my Amazon review and SHE WAS SPOT ON.  I made the choice to delete my review.  I repeat...I made the choice.  I am now back to compose MY REVIEW OF THE BOOK AS A WHOLE.  Amazon has a review system that needs work.  So, I am going to go by my own.  Hang in there with me!  Here goes:1.  First a caution.  When the author gives you the warning, read it, read it again and abide by it.  She means it!  I have read many dark reads but this was by far the hardest for me to read and the darkest for ME.  If you cannot handle very graphic descriptions of torture, abuse, torment, rape, murder, etc. then this is not a book you should venture to read.  The description of the things I just mentioned were graphic and disturbing that it caused ME to be sick.2.  The characters.  The heroine, Stella, is one of the strongest heroines you will ever read about.  She has had more pain and torment than any fictional character should ever have to endure.  She is the definition of STRONG.  So many words could be used to describe her.  She grew and healed and then...well, you will have to read.  Wesley, the alpha male who did not want permanence or forever.  Strong, loving, nurturing and supportive but also inexperienced and unsure and stubborn.  Loved them both.  The MONSTER...inhumane.3.  The plot/story.  There was the relationship between the H and h, the D/s relationship, the healing and dealing with the past, the obsessed sociopath, etc.  It had twists and turns and kept you on your toes.4.  Balance.  I, personally, like a good balance of bad and good...light and dark.  It does not have to be an even split by any means.  I do not need hearts and flowers at the end.  But, I do prefer a good balance.  When there is so much dark i t is hard to see any of the light.  This had too much dark for me and not enough light.5.  Grammar.  There were errors.  There were not tons, but they were present.  At times, I had to go back and re-read the sentence.6.  Language.  I can handle profanity in my reads and I am not a prude, nor do I have a stick up my arse.  But, sometimes the language that the H, h and her friends used was bothersome.  The H and h were very intelligent.  I think the h went to Columbia if I recall.  Their language did not always &#34;match&#34; them, even in their badass moments.7.  The ending.  The ending was horrific, horrendous and sickening.  There is no sugarcoating it.  There is not a HEA.  It made me vomit several times and I had nightmares that night.  It was very hard to get past.  After the ending, that's all I saw.  That is all that stayed with me because it was so horrific.  I could no longer see the beauty that I read previously because it was overshadowed by the ending.  I thought of the ending from the POV as a heroine, mother, woman and someone's significant other.  I thought about it from Wesley's POV.  Good God!  You will root for these two throughout the book.  You want them to have love and peace.  You want healing.  But, YOU WILL NOT GET IT.  KNOW THAT.  Here is the main point of my statement again...out of all that, what replays in my thoughts is the ending and the ending only.  For me, the beauty was lost.","05 5, 2014",ASLFWJ1KUWNZI,amac,Overshadowed by ending for ME.  Alternate ending would have made this a 5* for ME.,1399248000

B006TJDJKE,"[3, 4]",5,"I read this book for free.  I was skimming through the best free books list, and downloaded one or two which readers had rated excellent.  The first two books I read, I was surprised how any avid reader could have rated them with 5 stars. For this reason, I wasn't expecting this book to be any better.  When early on in the story, our hero ended up back in time, I honestly thought, Oh no, another rubbishy read.  I have since waited three days to write this review.  I needed to think about it seriously, because, as other readers have already mentioned, it opens a new concept of thought.  The reason that I found this book disturbing is because my Father had serious psychological problems.  The lives of my Mother, and I as a child, were absolute misery for years.  We endured both physical and mental torture over a period of time, which was impossible to forget.  Probably the worst part being that when my Father was on a high or good frame of mind, he was a good companion and warm person, who suddenly, for no apparent reason, turned into a person that filled us with dread.  For this reason, my sympathy has always been with families afflicted in the same manner, rather than with the patient.  My Father died eventually from a brain tumour, which nobody deserves to die of.  I had no bitterness left by then, as with maturity I realised that it was a sickness.  However, I cannot cope with people that have similar problems, and have found throughout life that the first characteristic I looked for in a friend or partner, was a rational mind.  I don't think that I would have read this book, if I had realised the content.  However, once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Yes, I found myself routing for Simon, held by the excellent prose and description of characters and scenes. This book fills your imagination, and draws so much empathy from the reader.  Even now, I'm still confused, is mental illness caused by disturbing childhood experiences, or can these illnesses be explain clinically, as another error in our DNA.  Why are some of us so badly affected by childhood experiences, while others simply move on with their lives.  Should we medicate sufferers to protect the innocent?  If you read this book, you will be left, like me, with many questions unanswered.  Perhaps in the future more research will answer these questions for us. I would recommend reading this book by a truly gifted writer.","03 5, 2012",A1I6BG5XRGOUJJ,Annie Athens,I FOUND THIS BOOK DISTURBING,1330905600

B00JNXUPG4,"[0, 5]",2,"I must have missed the memo. When exactly did the word erotica become synonymous with abuse? This is complete drivel--cheap thrills and post Fifty Shade of Grey crap with a paranormal twist. Seriously, it is one big rape fantasy and glorification of abuse.The thing is, I can understand the rape fantasy part. I REALLY don't enjoy reading them (in fact, I had to force myself to finish this one), but I understand women who do. I totally get facing that fear on safe pages and forcing it into something you can garner a little excitement and fun from instead of just a terror inducing real possibility. I get that.What I don't get it why women, WOMEN (of which Ms. Lake is just one of many) would continue to write all females as mindless, volition-less, disposable commodities who rather enjoy their own abuse, up to and including death and dismemberment (and starting in childhood). This book is littered with quotes like this: ""This woman has suffered since the day she was brought into this world."" Hasziel cupped her cheek and smoothed his thumb over her skin. ""It is the only place in which she finds comfort.""""What nonsense. This book even suggests that the female=tradable possession to be passed by a man to a man as reward belief exists even in Heaven. Wow, I bet that's what every good Christian woman dreams of when she prays for those pearly white gates.Why is this seen as sexy? Why is this so common that I'm tempted to call it clich&eacute;. Women in this book are collected, disparaged, drugged, raped (almost constantly as background noise), beaten, ""trained"" (which is a euphemism for being abused until they stop fighting back and become docile enough to be raped by others...but it's then presented as enjoying her position as sex slave), killed and dismembered. Meanwhile the MC is physically abused in some bastardized version of BDSM in which she has no control or realistic expectation of not being killed. In fact, she's terrified.Of course, she comes to love and crave it as an illustration of how all women really only want to be dominated, hurt and broken (and what good are they then?) by the men they love. (Thus, all those other women who have been abused and killed in the book probably enjoyed their rapes and murders too.) While simultaneously regaining memories of being gang raped by her father and his cronies, as if to suggest that any woman who desires something different than monogamous, vanilla sex must already have been defiled in some fashion. You'd think these were mutually exclusive, but apparently not.It's horrid. I went into this knowing it was a dark read. I'm no prude and enjoy the darker side of fiction (that's why I picked this book up in the first place), but that doesn't mean I wanted to spend 200+ being told how worthless my pssy and I are. I mean the whole concept of this book is that Xander can torture and kill people regularly, he can get head from a mindless sex slave, he can break women into said slave, he can kidnap, whip, and abuse Karinna, all with no heavenly repercussions. But god forbid his penls enter her v@gina, even in love, and he's condemned to Hell for all eternity. We women apparently aren't just worthless, our vileness is contagious.And let's not miss that it is essentially JUST women we're talking about. Almost as an afterthought Kid's are thrown in too (but one would presume they're at least half girls to start with and who know when boys age out of the victimizable children's group), but never, NEVER men. The book is very clear on this....""Nothing more stony and unapologetic than a bitter angel forced to leave the heavens--even demons avoided the Fallen. Humans, on the other hand, couldn't avoid them if they tried. Every day, kids and females got snatched up from the streets like smelt in a shallow pond, drugged and used at the amusement of their sadistic captors.""I could write an essay on the distancing technique being used in the use of 'female' instead of women, girls or a name (it crops up a lot). But I'll let that one go. What I really want to point out is that I'm always amazed that truly evil beings are still expected to adhere to strict heterosexual norms. Men are never victimised, be it in a any sort of homoerotic way or just, you know, basic power dynamics. Baffling.To wrap this up, I'd like it noted that at no point have I used the world misogynistic. Misogyny being the hatred of women and girls, but the word is often thrown around willy-nilly whenever a book or character treats women badly. I never got the impression that the author or even any of the cruelly dismissive men in the book hated women. To hate someone (as an individual or gender grouping) requires caring enough to have an opinion about them. It elevates them at least to the level of 'human enough to think about.'No one here did that. In a sense, I think this is worse. Women weren't hated. They were just not accorded any sense of human agency, or even faces as they're all masked as well as apparently thoughtless automatons. They were, as a whole, mere shadows that men act upon. I'm holding out hope that sometime in the near future the female population will realise that we're worth more than this.The book did try to redeem itself at the end by punishing the bad guys, but it was too little too late for me and really the exact same story could have been relayed without dehumanising every woman...excuse me, female...to pass the pages. (And been a darned good book too.) I'm giving this two stars and the only reason it's not a single star is that mechanically it's fairly well written. I like a spot of erotica here and again. I even like a bit of dark erotica. But I don't want to finish the book feeling like s*** about being a poor, pitiful, potentialess, penisless, disposable victim...i.e. a woman.","07 14, 2014",AUF0OPKICU6D4,Sadie Forsythe,1.5 **SPOILERISH**,1405296000

I did think that the story moved at a quick pace...sometimes a little too quickly for my taste. I would have liked a little more build up before the beginning of Abe and Gemma's romance, and I thought that the resolution to the 'problem' in the story came about just a little to quickly to make it believable. Break Me was written in the third person, which also tends to make me feel somewhat removed from the story...kind of like watching the moving when I'd rather be a part of it! I really liked that the story included perspectives of different characters throughout, as I'm always interested to see things from different points of view.Abe was SUCH a sweetheart of a book boyfriend, and I really loved the way he was with Gemma, giving her time and multiple reasons to learn to trust him. Gemma did have some maturing to do, so it was at times hard for me personally to identify with her at 28, but this would likely not be the case for younger adults to whom this story is targeted. In the end, the 'problem' in the story allowed both characters to mature and discover what they truly wanted and needed. I also loved that Gemma matured not only in her relationship with Abe, but also in her relationship with her family. This truly was somewhat of a coming-of-age story, as Gemma's experiences allowed her to grow and mature and to learn more about who she truly was.Break Me was very well-written!

B005GF315K,"[1, 2]",4,"Altered Destiny by Shawna Thomas is a novel that is going to be well received by fans of urban-fantasy romances with a bit of adventure tossed right into the mix. Though fantasy romances aren't that high on my favorites list in the world of romance, even with the first couple of chapters Shawna Thomas managed to reel me in and hold my attention until it was difficult for me to imagine anything else but the wondrous world which she has spun so well in this novel.There are the good old-fashioned humans and a race known as the Svistra whose savagery and notorious thirst for blood and pillaging keeps the humans awake at night. 20 year old Selia lives on the Outskirts and is the owner of the tavern that her mother left behind upon her death 5 years back. Though well versed in the art of defending herself, when it comes to love and desire, Selia is an innocent all the way.When Selia rescues a man being beaten to death only to find out that he is a Svistra, the uncomplicated life that she has known till then changes completely, plunging her into a world filled with uncertainty, treachery, man's thirst for vengeance and war and last but not the least the possibility of finding ever lasting love in the last place she expects to find it.When Jaden's golden gaze lands on his savior little does he know that the fearless woman who stands before him would come to mean everything to him. Having turned his back on his own race because his ideas didn't mesh with that of his father who is the leader of the Svistra, Jaden makes his way through the many different terrains that makes up their world until his journey brings him to the Outskirts and Selia with her gentle giant of a companion Oren.Never having being one to turn away a man or animal in need, the forced intimacy that caring for an injured brings to light the fact that humans may not have the complete picture when it comes o the Svistra. Jaden proves to be the opposite of what Selia has believed to be of the Svistra until now and when time and time again Jaden proves his loyalty, honesty and integrity in boundless different ways, Selia is no match to her heart's yearning for a man whose mere presence alone is enough to send her whole world into a tailspin.Jaden might want to do the honorable thing and stay away when it comes to Selia but his heart's yearning for a woman who seals her fate unknowingly by joining him in the most scared manner possible is one that refuses to be denied. But Jaden knows that without going back and facing those whom he has left behind and winning over the treacherous ruler who leads the whole Svistra clans towards endless war, there would never be a peaceful future for either the humans or the Svistra.Opening up a world that has so many intriguing aspects to it that I couldn't help but want even a crudely drawn map of where everything was situated, Altered Destiny tells the tale of brave men and a woman willing to fight for what they believe in. Jaden's character is an alluring one, one who made my heart yearn for him and of course love him because he has that inner strength that lets him be true to himself and what he believes in. Jaden's honesty and integrity is what drew me most towards his character, and the way he is possessive of Selia even when he believes he has nothing of substance to offer her made my heart go pitter patter.Selia is a wonderful heroine whom I loved from the instance she couldn't turn her back on a wounded man. Even knowing that caring for a Svistra would end up in herself paying for it in blood doesn't stop her from doing what's right. The slow awakening of Selia's senses when it comes to Jaden is something to be savored. And a heroine who doesn't believe in being coy and has no qualms about being herself is one that always earns my wholehearted approval. Worthy of a mention is her relationship with Oren, a man gentle as he is huge, a character who will remain with me for a long time even after I am done with the book. His simplistic view on life, right and wrong proved to be quite refreshing in a novel that practically seeps with half truths and the treachery that goes right along with the hunger for ultimate power.Though there were certain aspects of the novel such as the occasional swear words which just felt out of place with the whole tone set for the rest of the story and the fact that the final showdown between Jaden and his brother never fully materialized in the novel, I still enjoyed this immensely and would definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.One character from the story that I would love a future book to be based on, if Ms. Thomas ever thinks of writing a sequel is Nathan. If Jaden had not been in the picture, I would have completely given myself over to him. And even with Jaden in the picture, his character nevertheless proved to be a compelling one, which is telling in itself how remarkable a talent Ms. Thomas has when it comes to creating her characters.Rating=4.5/5Reviewed by Maldivian Book Reviewer (MBR)","09 19, 2011",A576L6YAOW6IP,"maldivianbookreviewer ""Book Reviews - From th...","Wondrous world, characters & story!",1316390400

B005NWH936,"[0, 1]",3,"Okay I have to say, I gave this three stars, not because it was a bad story, but because it dragged for me; and because I found the torrid love scenes at times overblown and in appropriate for the action that was supposedly happening to and around them.Also I would advise buying these stories singly instead of as a bundle.  I say this because, if I hadn't bought as a bundle, and didn't feel compelled to move to the next story immediately, I might have felt more favorable to the stories themselves.As a whole I liked the stories and the concept, but I found myself just wanting the author to get on with the real underlying story and events and less of the hot, sweaty sex. Which is a real eye opener as I usually love that aspect of the shifter stories.  I find the erotic nature of these man/beasts extremely provocative and tantalizing, but for some reason, these stories just had too much and it interfered with my enjoyment of the plot and the stories.I would buy them again as separate stories that I could take a break from and then resume and I think that might be the key to this series.

B009C63MRQ,"[1, 1]",5,"Kindle version free via author for honest reviewThis book is a modernized, ""techy"" version of Frankenstein.  Victor is a homeschooled teen who wants to win admission to the higher tech university he wishes to go to.  To do this he decides to create a chatbot who can talk to people all over the world and answer questions by taking information from all the online places Victor has gone.  He is so focused on his chatbot creation that he seems to forget that he is on a cruise with a beautiful girl whom he likes.  Through text messages, web browsing, and emails Elizabeth, Henry, and Victor chat and try to figure out solutions to problems.  Some of those problems are teenage stuff like how Victor won't take time away from his computer to go with Elizabeth to see the sites off the ship or even to dinner with her on the ship.  Also, Henry has feelings for Elizabeth, but knows she likes Victor so he is a good friend and encourages her to do what she wants as far as trying to get Victor to notice her.  Then there are other problems that come up, like how Victor finally completes his chatbot, but it seems to be taking on a mind of its own and not in a good way.  It is causing problems for Victor and is hacking into all his personal stuff.  Can the three teens figure out a way to stop an unstoppable chatbot?  How can you shut something down that seems to know what you are going to do and when?After reading iDrakula I knew I had to check this book out too.  I found the book very interesting in how Victor builds his ""monster"" out of techy bits instead of used body parts.  He creates a monster, but in a different and more modern form...a chatbot.  I am not super familiar with Frankenstein, but was able to follow this book just fine.  It has the same theme to it, but in a different era.  I loved the chatbot theory and how they had to try and fight technology at its best to figure out if there was a way to stop V.V. the chatbot.  I also enjoyed the pictures Elizabeth took and sent out via her cell phone.  A touch of the past in a modernized story.  This was a quick and easy read for me, and I think that's what made it all that much more enjoyable to me.  I was able to read a good book written in a ""format"" that I use daily myself.  It was fun to read a story in the perspective of texts and emails that still made perfect sense to me.  The plot was engaging, the characters were great, and the writing was unique and enjoyable.  This book was like a breath of fresh air to me.  It was unique, but enjoyable to read at the same time and was understandable.

B00CA9DEYS,"[3, 3]",5,"In the Shadow of Greed was one of those rare books that swept me up from the get-go. Weeks wove an absolutely fantastic tale of greed, intrigue and really steamy love. Dr. Sarah is so awkward and inside of her own head that you cannot help but love her. Jason is the perfect antidote to her buttoned up nature, with his oh-so-hot cop mentality. Of course, the rest of McNeils and the strong bond Jason has with his family make you love him just that much more.I'm struggling to write this review, not because the book was difficult to review but because I ABSOLUTELY adored it and I just want to gush, but I do not want to give too much away. I'm having a total fan-girl moment over here.Hannah's character just added this element of complete emotional connection to the book. I cried over some of her scenes. Perhaps that is what makes In the Shadow of Greed so successful. Weeks has an amazing ability to pull emotional responses from her readers. I laughed, I cried, I gasped in suspense.I am a huge fan of cop dramas, but even on my favorite shows, I can usually figure out the plot. In the Shadow of Greed kept me guessing and the steamy romance between Jason and Sarah kept me distracted in the most delicioius way. This book is a MUST READ for anyone who loves a good romance or a good mystery. It's beautifully written.Disclaimer: I was gifted a copy of this ebook in exchange for an honest review.

B00BJ3OFXU,"[6, 6]",5,"This review can also be found on my Goodreads Page.Thank you to the author for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.I was not sure what to expect when I started this story. Typically you can find me with my nose in my NOOK with a romance novel. You know, the one where boy meets girl and she's swept off her feet. Yeah, that. Lately, I `ve been looking for something different. Something to bring me out of my book funk. This was it.Toxic is not your usual happy go lucky story. It hurts. It hurts to read. You become so wrapped up in the main character's story. I have never read anything by this author before, but I am now forever a fan. This was brilliant.Toxic is a story about Logan Reynolds and her life. From a child through her teenage and adult years, Logan had a rough life. The book is written in somewhat of a diary form, where every chapter is dated. I really enjoyed that because it allowed the story to flow nicely and you truly felt like you were on a journey with Logan.Logan was born to a drug addict and alcoholic mother.  Her father is not in the picture. The story begins where Logan has to get ready for her first day of kindergarten on her own. Yes, you read that correctly. She had to do it all on her own at five years old.""A lot of the smaller kids have their Mama's with them, but I don't feel jealous because I don't want mine with me.""""I don't sleep at all. I never do when she holds me because it feels wrong. All I do is wonder if it's supposed to feel wrong when a Mama holds her baby girl""My heart went out to Logan. I think I truly enjoyed this story because Logan was real. The author did a great job at character development.  You felt the loneliness that Logan went through. Logan had a spirit, a fighting one, however as she get older she stopped fighting and gave in to her surroundings. The story followed her into her teen and young adult life. She succumbed to alcohol, drugs, and abuse. No that is not giving away the story. The events that occur during this time are heartbreaking. The human spirit is strong. Logan is proof of that.""We're toxic, but only the best things are""Were there boys in the story? Yes! But, not like you think. I love that the author involved love and romance but did not make it the focal point. There are boys in there that put Logan in unspeakable situations. My heart broke for her every time.Then there was Nathan...""I just want you the way you are""Oh Nathan. Every girl could use someone like you in their lives.  I don't want to give too much away, but he is the knight that every girl deserves. He is reason. He is truth.Overall, I was absolutely blown away by this story. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to read and review this book. It reminded me why I love to read. It reminded me of how strong the human spirit truly is.  I really hope there is a follow up to this story or at least an ending. Logan deserves one.","05 12, 2013",A31I1MMDL0LIFK,Bianca,Review of Toxic,1368316800

It is easy to relate to Alex, the narrator, and to love him, despite his flaws and mistakes.  And, Seb - he breaks your heart and then puts it back together.  Their devotion to each other was uplifting in a setting/world that was often scary and depressing.  I loved how, as the story progressed,  Alex and Seb helped each other uncover their true selves and, in the process, saved themselves from the potentially bleak lives they could have led.  Sara Alva does a fantastic job painting the picture of Seb and Alex's world.  She does equally well with the supporting characters.  They are all unique, complex people with their own stories. I thought the ending of the book was pitch perfect - hopeful, yet realistic - true to the love Seb and Alex have.  I would love, love, love to read a sequel to find out how they grow into adulthood.  I adored Sara Alva's book, Social Skills, but I think she has topped it with Silent.  She is definitely a must-read author for me.","11 26, 2013",A3BKYK19JP3WT5,Jen,Amazing!,1385424000

The story is told from both perspectives so you see the battle between the two think about what they have had and what they want while fighting to stay alive.  Though I've never been in danger like this, the scenes flowed well and seemed reasonable.  And now a bit about the story...When his father passes, Matt had become the man of the house and responsible for his mother and two sisters at the the age of nine.  As soon as he could escape he joined Army and once his tour was over he said goodbye to being responsible for anyone other than himself.  He had a nice life as a carpenter and enjoyed doing construction.  Until one day his former Army buddy, now police officer, calls him to protect his sister Tessa.  As Tessa and Matt fight to survive and figure out who really is the bad cop the relationship between them grows.  But Tessa remembers the last time she let a man mean something to her - her brother almost died.  The deja vu is almost as bad as the cops after them.  Dance along with Tessa and Matt as they discover the truth!Favorite passages:- &#34;I'll be fine.&#34; When he got his mind back on business and out of her underwear.- &#34;Plans don't always go the way we expect.

B00HOIH342,"[1, 1]",5,"Behind His Eyes: Convicted-The Missing Years Absofreakinglutely BLEW ME AWAY!  What a captivating read by Aleatha Romig that you just COULD. NOT. PUT. DOWN!  This 4th installment on the Consequences story was by far my most favorite hands down, no doubts about it.  The journey through Consequences, Truth, Convicted and Now the Missing Years, is one you won&#8217;t forget and will most likely read again.  Tony was the one who I really wanted to get inside of his head, his oh so beautiful mind, but we also heard from Harry, John, Brent and Phil.  Seeing their perspectives of what was endured from Tony&#8217;s Legal Troubles to Claire Being Institutionalized was eye opening.  Characters you don&#8217;t think have that much to do with the story in fact step into the limelight and open your eyes.  Love isn't finding a perfect person. It's seeing an imperfect person perfectly.This entire series had me gripping my seat.  Aleatha did a fantastic job bringing all of the characters to light.  The Connection between Tony and Claire as well as how every other person you meet during the Consequences stories fall into place.  You find out what Meredith gained from talking to Claire.  Through the boys, Harry, Phil, John and Tony you really gain perspective on what Claire was going through when she was with Tony.  The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy or unfulfilled.  For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers ~ M. Scott PeckLove is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own and we saw this through this whole installment.  The love that Tony and Claire shared was real, raw, undeniable and unattainable by anyone else.  You could really see the hell, my bent, not broken lovely Tony went through to defend his true loves.  You could finally feel the hurt, experience the anger, guilt and heartache Tony endured.  Throughout the entire series, which I LOVED every single book, including the BHE companions I loved Tony, Loved to Hate to Love that Man.  He always made sure everyone knew actions have consequences, but when you see Tony himself finally face his and you will finally understand his reasoning behind all the madness.BHE Convicted- The Missing Years was a stunning conclusion to a mind-blowing, captivating series.  Courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.  That brave man is Tony Rawlings.  That beautiful stunning, strong brave man, that many of you may hate but I promise will not after this is that brave man.  He may be bent but he&#8217;s certainly not broken, and anything not broken can always be pieced back together.  True love is never easy, but you overcome your fears and fight like hell to preserve it.Thank you Aleatha for allowing us to feel and fall in love with Tony and Claires journey!5+++++++++++ Stars for this one.

It's March of 2013!  I have not heard very much about The Education of Sebastian and am sad it is not getting the word of mouth spread around by readers that is deserves. I HIGHLY recommend this book to EVERYONE! I think it worries some readers of the age difference between Caroline (30) and Sebastian who is 17. Please don't let that stop you from reading this book and READ, READ, READ this novel. I promise you won't be disappointed!The Education of Sebastian is a sad, emotional novel that will pull on your heart. It is one of those books that will make you feel sad; sad for everyone involved and of course the two main characters. Caroline is a 30 year-old married military wife to David. She only married David at the young age of 19 to get away from her mother who was not really a mother to young Caroline. Caroline and David never really loved each other, he in controlling and uses Caroline to help his status in the military of having the perfect young housewife. When first married the two get stationed in San Diego, this is where Caroline first meets an 8 year Sebastian. Caroline took care of Sebastian because his parents were alcoholic drunks who ignored him. They had a special relationship where sparked his interest in all things Italian. Caroline and David were transferred to the east coast, 9 years later returning to San Diego Caroline sees Sebastian again, this time he is 17 but looking more like a man in his 20's. As the two reconnect sharing stories of their horrible home life they begin a romantic relationship and fall in love, having to hide their affair while trying to plan a future... together.I loved everything about this book. I love the character of Caroline, my heart ached for her but not as much as Sebastian. Yes the age difference is a bit strange and took me a little bit to get into their romance, I won't lie. Once you read more of their relationship together and understand their connection I completely forgot about their age difference and wanted nothing more than for them to be able to have their happy ever after. I just knew their affair would come to heads and drama would unfold. I was anticipating it at every page. I kept thinking every time they would sneak around this would be the moment they would get caught.The ending is heart wrenching... oh my. My heart was breaking into a million tiny pieces. I started reading The Education of Caroline (The Education Of... #2) ASAP! I couldn't let their story escape me even for a moment. I am totally invested into Caroline and Sebastian. I really hope they will be okay, this is definitely a must read series.I give The Education of Sebastian (The Education Of... #1) 5 Stars.","03 4, 2013",A39B4H20EJ9PMT,Jessica's Book Review,"Once you get past the age difference, it is a beautiful romantic story of love and lost.

I really loved the history that was woven into the story. I have always loved Native American culture, so naturally I just soaked up the stories, legends, and history told. Then there's Skylar and Rafael, oh lord, they have made themselves right at home at the top of my favorite list! Their relationship and how it evolves is so precious. I loved how Skylar would catch Rafael staring at him, and through the writing, you just knew how Rafael felt about him. Not to mention his love for books, and his drawing... loved when Skylar would look over at him, and his nose would be in a book, or he would be drawing... obvious to the world, around him. But always knew what Skylar was doing, or thinking. Skylar is just adorable, there is no other word I can describe him as. Having no voice, he is always smiling, always concerned about everyone else. So sweet, and innocent. Their relationship is a slow process, but so enjoyable to read. The story involves everyone on the Reservation, and you can't help but love everyone.This series is really a amazing read, the writing is fabulous, Rose Christo is an amazing story teller, and advocate. She really sheds light on the many issues plaguing her people, and after learning about these (more then horrifying) issues, I was very eager to go off and read more, and sign the petitions she offered.Highly recommend this series, and anything by Rose Christo!

When Drake walks back into her life with an apology and an explanation, Marly realizes things aren't always what they seemed. Drake and Marly both have secrets, past and present to work through.

The story line focuses on love lost, love redeemed, different types of love, and the enduring power of love to heal. Themes explored include bad choices--by many of the characters--and the long-lasting effects of those choices on the lives of many around them, the inter-connectedness of relationships, the growth of character, and the strength to make the right choice when society or convention deems it the wrong choice. This book is a true winner--kept me up til the wee hours of the night--had to finish it in one fell swoop. Could not put it down.The book itself is a sweeping saga from pre-WWI to post-war.  Background and cultural aspects are well developed and interesting. Book is filled with memorable secondary characters. I loved the symbolism and allegories.There is a lot of pain, suffering , misunderstandings, etc. of which I am not usually a big fan. But this not a melodrama.

Not to mention that his existence as a Si&oacute;ga Feiceann has been confirmed. While those of his kind are labeled as Fae assassin's, he knows he's not a threat to the Light Fae world. In fact, he's an avid supporter, and would do anything to aid Max with anything he needs.When his protection becomes compromised, Tony is forced to flee to the one place he never thought he'd set foot in ever again. His uncle is less than pleased to see him, and yearns to send him back to his mother's arms. Unfortunately, that's something that won't happen just yet. The Unseelie threat has become far more cumbersome than anyone could have ever imagined, and it must be vanquished, at all costs.Allowed to reside with his uncle for the time being, he soon begins to learn the in's and out's of his unique heritage. Granted, being a Si&oacute;ga Feiceann isn't as easy as it sounds. Never-the-less, Tony is quite willing to learn as much as possible in order to lend his uncle and those beneath his tutelage a helping hand.Ironically, there's one thing he never counted upon: Jillian O'Neal. Her sudden appearance has rocked his world in more ways than one. The fact that he finds himself greatly attracted to her does nothing to deter him from the task at hand, however. Although, he cannot deny that he's drawn to her as they spend more and more time together.Tony vows to protect her from the danger crawling towards their very doorstep. While she may be a tad reluctant to allow himself to do so, she finds it hard to remain at arm's length from him for long. Deep inside, they're tied to one another, even if they won't admit it. He soon learns more about himself than he ever thought possible. He, Max, and his new friends will need to set their differences aside if they're to band together in hopes of vanquishing the oncoming evil, once for all.This was truly a lovely addition to the Soul Mates series. I enjoyed it immensely. This takes up a little ways after Soul Mate ends, and lends further insight to the existing war between the Fae and the Unseelie kingdom. It was nice to see Max and Tony grow stronger in the face of such adversity. The brief glimpses into Max and Anna's world as parents was certainly endearing. I did encounter a couple spots where certain punctuation was missing/grammar needed to be fixed, but I didn't let that deter me from enjoying the story itself.

I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Sabine is still close to her former brother- in-law and when he asked her to do him a favor by participating in a charity fundraiser Sabine goes along. It seems there is to be a bachelor auction and Sabine is to rescue a man named Todd by bidding on him .  Sabine is under the impression Todd is gay and is only participating in the auction because of his company and because he still hasn't fully disclosed his sexual preference.  But, the joke is on Sabine when she bids on Todd only to discover she bought the wrong Todd.Todd is a Hawaiian native and a celebrity TV chef.  He's hot stuff and is sought after for his looks and fame.  But, Todd is tired of all that and wants a woman that likes him for who he is really is, not the celebrity persona.  After the infamous auction,  Todd discovers Sabine's motives for buying him and so they know where they stand right from the start.  That doesn't stop Todd from planning Sabine a wonderful home cooked meal. What Sabine discovers is that Todd is really a nice down to earth guy and she finds she is very attracted to him and not just because he looks like sex on a stick.So, what's the problem?  Well, Sabine's ex-husband cheated on her and then before the ink was dry on the divorce papers he had already remarried. With two children in college and staring straight at the big  4 0 ,  and like most of us in real life, there are few extra pounds around the mid- section,  Sabine's confidence isn't very high and she's just not sure she is ready to date at all,  much less date someone younger than her and famous to boot.As the media pounces on the romance, Todd and Sabine try to keep things low key, but Todd is getting serious about Sabine.  Will Sabine be ready to make a commitment on the same level as Todd or will her insecurities prevent her from taking a second chance on love?This novel is short and sweet,  a great way to end the day or pass your lunch hour with.  A feel good story with real romance .  There are steamy moments too, but there is real depth and feeling in Todd and Sabine's relationship.

At first, Cloot did not want to give any of the toys away. How would he choose which ones to give away? He finally came up with a plan to help him decide. Cloot gathered all his toys and spread them on the ground. His dad helped him choose toys to give to boys and girls at the hospital. They boxed them up and Cloot spent the afternoon giving them out.Soon all the kids from the neighborhood were bringing their toys to share with the children in the hospital. Clutter Cut Inc. was a great success.My favorite thing about this book is that it teaches young children how to decide what to keep and what to give away. This is a difficult skill to learn, even for big kids. This book goes through the process of sorting, choosing, boxing and giving things to others. If children learn this process at a young age, it will be so much easier to live a clutter-free life in adulthood.","07 6, 2011",A2BE9VAS3RZ78R,Janette Fuller,Teach Kids To Deal With Clutter,1309910400

B00FUX7QUO,"[0, 0]",4,"First let me say that I have read more than my fair share of supernatural books involving ""werewolves"". But right from the start this book is different in a couple of ways-- its written from a male point of view and Audouin-Mamikonian does that very well. It was refreshing to read a book from the main male character. Secondly the main character Indiana, is not a werewolf and the book centers on him dealing with that fact in a werewolf world. This book is also from an author that I have never read anything from before so I was interested to dive in. In the end it was a fun, quick, and fast paced read with likeable characters. Actually I read it in one night.Indian Teller - the main character in this story. He is the mostly human grandson of the leader of the werewolves. Indiana's father was a werewolf but his mother was human ---with a gift.Growing up in the pack of werewolves but not being one made Indiana's life difficult. His humor, intelligence and resilience throughout the book make him a likeable and relatable character that you root for throughout the book. At the age of 18 years old Indiana convinces his Grandparents to allow him to go to college where he meets Tyler - an adversary, and Kat - a love interest.The story had mystery in the form of Indiana's mothers gift, betrayal from someone within the pack, love, members of the same race coming to odds with each other, and help from an unlikely source.The ending tied up a lot of loose ends while still leaving huge openings for the story to continue in a second book.

Jared reluctantly gives the riveting Lacy a ticket as he never lets anyone off with a warning! Yet, he is intrigued, as is Lacy. Imagine their surprise when they both meet up again at the very bar that Lacy was headed to for Angela's party. After getting a thorough set down from her manipulative sister, Angela, Lacy is obliged to play one of her little games.Jared Kelly found himself attracted to Lacy while at the traffic stop and never imagined that she would end up being related Angela. He has already been on the receiving end of Angela's machinations. Jared isn't too keen on going with the ""kiss me"" request on the cocktail napkin, but he can't deny that he wouldn't mind exploring something more with Lacy. However, he isn't too eager when he believes that Lacy and Angela are cut from the same cloth. Angela continues her dirty dealings as these two try to work something out. Will they be able to ignore the vindictive woman, or will their budding relationship crash before it ever takes off?Kiss Me started out as such a hot, unique story that pulled me in from the moment they made eye contact. However, it soon let me down rather abruptly.Angela was a POW that never seemed to get her comeuppance and despite the fact that both Jared and Lacy claimed they were going to change, the proof was never there in Kiss Me. Lacy continually ran when the going got tough and, frankly, Jared ventured down that road as well. Jared wanted to protect Lacy, but I never saw any evidence of this protection in Kiss Me. He let Angela verbally abuse both Lacy and him, and he said nothing to the little shrew.In the end, Jared and Lacy were the perfect couple for each other in Kiss Me as they deserved one another. I was eagerly anticipating the knockdown of spoilt Angela, but I found I was disappointed in the end. Jared wasn't always consistent either. He claimed he never lets people off with a warning. However, he lets Angela off with one, which made it look like Jared cared more about Angela than he said he did. Kiss Me made it look plausible that Jared was looking to strike back at Angela for dumping him by hooking up with Lacy, and that was a little frustrating. Lacy seemed to not understand that she wasn't thwarting another's advances and rewarding them for their good behavior, either. She was giving in and letting someone else pull her around and allowing the opportunity to be called a few names too in Kiss Me.There was no real growth in Lacy or Jared other than what they vocalized, but they never truly showed in Kiss Me. However, Lacy's aunt was very amusing! Kiss Me should have had the nasty, manipulative woman suffering for her actions during the story as she made the h/H suffer throughout Kiss Me.Vanessa for Joyfully Reviewed","09 8, 2012",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,"""Angela was a POW that never seemed to get her comeuppance""",1347062400

B008UC6G4O,"[0, 0]",4,"This is my second book by this writing team (my first was Truthful Change) and I am sure it won't be my last! They seem to create characters that spark my interest and make me want to just keep reading. I can actually see everything they are ""showing"" me and I like that in a story I have purchased to entertain me. I was able to clearly see myself in the Square Peg (the Gay friendly bar owned by the 2 main character's) having a drink and chatting with Vin the bartender. I was able to immerse myself in this book and I quite enjoyed the vacation from my real life.The story starts with Benjamin, a mild mannered accountant by day, inheriting half interest in a gay bar from his estranged father. Shane was the live above the bar longtime manager who now owns the other half. The instant squabbling between the two was entertaining and very understandable. Ben has a business and numbers background and has big plans to improve the bar while Shane has a history with the place and no desire to change a thing. More arguing ensues when the true problems Square Peg faces comes to light and both men have to learn to compromise. A sexual chemistry that burned up my Kindle adds another level to their already shaky partnership. When they finally got their HEA, I had to just sit back and exhale.....loudly ... and smile because these guys really had to work for it.The BDSM aspect was fairly nicely done. I admit to a slight squick regarding two small (or maybe not so small) things that Ben does to Shane. One is a ""slap"" across the face and another is a ""slap"" to Shane's head.  It threw me a bit because as many BDSM themed books as I have enjoyed (M/M and M/F) I have never seen that type of ""discipline"" meted out. I was able to remind myself that Ben was brand new to his Dom kink and that together they were just feeling their way but it just did not sit well with me. It was not violent per say nor repeated throughout the story so I was able to finish the book and enjoy it but for some this could be a red flag. Ben was seriously possessive of Shane and the writers really made it obvious that Shane and Ben had a very loving relationship that included a BDSM element but it very easily could have read differently. It's a fine line IMHO so just beware.The secondary characters were incredible. I am not so silently hoping that we will get Vin's story sometime soon please?? He could almost have stolen the show from our main men and I loved him. All in all I would recommend Square Peg to those who love their M/M with angst, heat, romance and a well-deserved HEA.

I will admit, when I saw that this book was about gargoyles, I wasn't sure what to expect. I pictured the winged lions that you see on the sides of buildings. How on earth were they going to be part of a young adult paranormal romance? Boy was I wrong. These gargoyles are a pack of extremely good looking, romantic, and tough, young men. Mix Jacob's wolf pack with Edward's vampire family, throw in a pinch of boy band, and you have an idea of the gargoyles. LOVED IT. The storyline grabbed me right from the beginning and not once did it drag or feel forced.

B00G1X9G1Y,"[3, 3]",5,"When the story began with Trip and his two best girl friends, Rina and Jillian, getting ready to do the Organ Run in Central Park ~ hundreds of costumed joggers running from zombies ~ I knew immediately I was in for another great read by Damon Suede. Discovering the story involved a graphic artist and a monster-makeup creator just made me even more interested in reading it.Trip is a graphic artist with a secret crush on his editor and colleague, Cliff, who is completely straight and, as far as I can tell, is just using Trip for his genius artistic abilities. I mean, let's face it, Big Dog Comics is getting a serious amount of art out of Trip but not allowing him to script anything other than the bland stuff all because Trip is an idiot and keeps hoping Cliff will notice him and all of a sudden discover he's gay. Not gonna happen, buddy. Plus, the comic he does the art for is seriously staid about a bunch of high school kids. There's no sex, no blood, just issues about acne and peer pressure. Boring! Good thing Trip accepts commissions because otherwise he thinks his brain might ooze from his ears. Life looks up when he meets Silas at the zombie run. Silas is hot, even in full zombie makeup, and Trip thought he was flirting with him but they both forgot to exchange numbers. Now, Trip is trying a little subterfuge to locate Silas, and really hoping it works.Silas does FX makeup for the stars, and his specialty is gore and wounds. What a thing to put on a resume, huh? He's so mad when he can't find Trip again during or after the race because he thought they had some chemistry. Silas is a lot different than Trip in the dating department. I guess it's easiest to just say that Silas has had a lot, and I mean a lot, of hookups and short-term dating, but something about Trip makes him wonder if there isn't more to life. When Trip tracks him down and calls him, Silas is ecstatic and they meet for dinner. It's a bit of an odd first date as Trip is still upset at Cliff stealing his pitch for a new comic and having someone else draw it. What? So, Silas and Trip sort of stumble around each other in that first date nightmare. The second date goes much better and they both are realizing how much chemistry they have together, and this is before anything physical!Rina and Trip do a brainstorming session where the character of Scratch, an incubus, is created and a basic idea is born for a &#34;very graphic novel&#34; for adults. While Trip is drawing and thinking and doubting, he and Silas continue to date and when things do get physical it's pretty intense. I completely and totally fell for Trip and Silas. Both of them so hesitant to trust, to open up, to be vulnerable, even as they are doing those exact things. I loved how they brought out the best in each other and how they managed to come up with ideas for Scratch when they would just be talking to each other. Not brainstorming, just regular conversations where something Silas says would light a match in Trip's brain. Trip makes Silas feel valued and cared about and Silas makes Trip feel like he can do anything and his talent and ideas have value. Silas encourages Trip to try and interest publishers and fans in Scratch at the next comic convention, but Trip is scared and has a lot of doubts. What if he loses his guaranteed work with Big Dog, or loses the respect of his fans and others in the industry when he introduces a gay incubus graphic novel? Which he's not even finished with? Trip thinks it's way too risky and Silas thinks you need to risk to win.What a fantastic book! Damon Suede really knows how to keep my attention, and considering this is a fairly long novel, that is saying quite a bit. I was on pins and needles waiting to see if Trip would finally see Cliff for the giant a-hole he is and see how much he played on all of Trip's fears and doubts in order to use him. God, I despised Cliff! I wasn't so sure how I felt about Trip at the end, because it's really all his fault what happens, and I personally felt he got off easy in the blame game. I adored Silas, every single inch of him and want one for myself. I absolutely adored this book. The writing is phenomenal, the characters are fantastic, the psychology is real, and the sex is hot.

She&#8217;s been able to get past a pretty hurtful breakup and is adjusting to life as the fianc&eacute;e of the town&#8217;s veterinarian.  Life is pretty good.  For Small Town, USA, that is.  Things take a turn for the worse when there&#8217;s a dead body found up on one of the big local farms.  Suddenly everything is turned upside-down.  Not just because there&#8217;s clearly been a murder, but because her ex is now here working the case with her.  He&#8217;s a Texas Ranger and is assigned to help on the case.  A distraction she doesn&#8217;t need especially when this turns into a real humdinger case of who-done-it.  The murder turns out to be the tip of the iceberg and Laney uncovers a huge case of debt, drugs and deceit.  The likes she never thought she&#8217;d see in her small town.  Add working alongside her sexy as sin ex and digging up all sorts of feelings she&#8217;d like to leave behind, and this may prove to be the hardest case of Laney&#8217;s life.Whew, talk about a mystery that had me on the edge of my seat until the end!  Laney sure had her hands full from the very beginning and with so many colorful townspeople and viable suspects; she had her work cut out for her.  That poor gal was put through the ringer in this book but I loved that she never gave up&#8230;or even thought about quitting.

I think this is a great start to the series and feel like we have a great foundation for the series to come.Thank you , Jodi, for Pretty Reckless!

I did enjoy it, yes, but not nearly as much as Ripped.What I liked:Rosie&#8230; for the most part. She&#8217;s a strong, independent woman, and she stands up for herself when her boyfriend in the beginning of the story tells her that she makes him feel less masculine &#8211; that she needs to act like a girl so that he feels better about himself. That scene made me love her character, because she knew who she was and she wasn&#8217;t willing to give up who she was in order to make the guy happy.Hunter. He was a bit intense at times, but he was a likeable love interest. He wasn&#8217;t overbearing, and he genuinely seemed to have Rosie&#8217;s best interests at heart. At times he did come off as a bit too perfect, but I still liked him.The scenes with Hayley and Rosie. Like I said, I preferred Ripped to Burned, and that&#8217;s mainly because Hayley&#8217;s story was a lot of fun. Having her pop up in Burned was great. Her scenes with Rosie were light, but they also highlighted their strong relationship as sisters.The ending. The ending was perfect for this story. It was sweet and it helped to tie up loose ends in the story.What I didn&#8217;t like:Rosie, at times.

I know, I know. I said I liked the ending, and I did. But I also felt as though it was rushed.

B00IU69PTI,"[0, 0]",4,"New Adult fans you are going to enjoy this debut novel by Jules Barnard. It is well written and the perfect length. I am truly surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this book. As of late I have found that I am a bit burned out on the New Adult genre. Same storyline. Same Character types. blah blah blah. Her characters are relatable, intelligent, sexy and pretty realistic. No poor me heroine here! Cali, the main character is at a crossroads and is trying to figure what she really wants out of life and making those hard choices to get there.Cali is a recent college graduate. She plans on starting Law School the following year. Cali and her best friend Gen move to Lake Tahoe for the summer to work at a Casino. She has a boyfriend, the same guy for the past few years but things are slowly falling apart between the two of them. She meets Jaeger(LOVE THE NAME) and she feels like she knows him from somewhere.... Jaeger is hot as sin and a bit mysterious. He is an ex athlete, loves fishing and carving wood. Yep, carving wood. He is one lovable character that will have you swooning throughout the story.Misunderstandings, miscommunications, work drama, and one of the craziest exes I have ever encountered in a book make for one heck of a read. It looks like Gen(the BFF) is getting her own book next and once you read Deep Blue you will see how much her character needs her story told. I can not wait to find out all of her secrets and how her story plays out! 4 Stars &#60;3","03 11, 2014",A1G6UIQG93XC0E,Her Juicy Reads-Kristen,Great Debut!,1394496000

B004ZG8KRK,"[3, 3]",5,"Joe Caf&eacute; centres on the kidnapping of lap dancer Sara by psychotic killer Chet Mooney. While her boyfriend and the police look for them, the novel hones in on the private hell the dancer is going through at the hands of a man who is intent on purging his hatred on her.The narrative voice is strong from the outset:`Joe Caf&eacute; opened in 1969 with no fanfare. It was a small-fronted diner. The kind of place that looks old for no discernible reason, dirty though it is impeccably clean.'Stylistically the novel is both elegant and dark, moving between evocative descriptive passages and sharp edge dialogue. Using flashbacks it gets you inside the killer's head and Mader cleverly manages to allow you to see the reasons Chet Mooney has ended up this way. This is one of the strengths of Joe Caf&eacute;, it digs behind the behaviour of the characters and gets beneath the skin. In its thematic darkness and narrative style Joe Caf&eacute; is a Noir novel and a fine one at that.Mader has also structured his first novel brilliantly, moving with ease between the different perspectives of the characters. After the first chapter it is extremely hard to put down. You are pulled into the maelstrom of events sparked off by the abduction. Mader has a native elegance to his prose that offsets the more disturbing aspects of the novel.The descriptions of being held captive and the physicality of the experience are powerfully told:`The hardest part is mental. We get used to having stimuli pounding into our brains. We get used to traffic and billboards and radio cures for baldness. Being in a dark room, tied to a chair, is an agony few experience.'Sara's imprisonment is the physical centre of the narrative as attempts to rescue her are made.This is a sharply written highly readable novel that takes you to the dark side, I highly recommend it.","10 7, 2011",A2J4GZH4B9LXPY,"Richard Godwin ""Author Of Apostle Rising""",Tight Noir,1317945600

B007K3E178,"[2, 3]",5,"I will admit, as soon as my iPhone dinged with an email last night, I knew it was my notification that this book was now on my various Kindle related devices and ready to download.  I was giddy with anticipation and was glad I only had 10 more pages to read in the book in my hand so I could jump right to this one.  An hour and a half later, I was glad I choose to forego sleep so I could spend the wee hours of the morning with Todd, Ben and Erin.For those that may not have read picked up any of the Brown Sibling books, Todd, Ben and Erin are from the first book in the series, Laid Bare.  The threesome have had to overcome personal and family  prejudices, emotional devastation and learning compromise between friends to lovers in order to get to their HEA.  As Laid Open begins, we can see that everything they went through made them a stronger unit and created a family that is filled with love.  And in any family unit, no matter how strong, mommy and daddy (or daddies in this case) need some alone time to solidify those bonds.Laid Open gives us an opportunity to see how Todd, Ben and Erin decompress from the trials and tribulations of home and reconnect with each other.  Let me tell you...it's freaking hot.  Not only do they strengthen their ties as a threesome, but Ben and Todd take their relationship to a higher level of closeness.It was wonderful catching up with the three of them and seeing just how much they have grown from their book.  There are still emotional scars they must deal with, but they have truly built a unified front that could probably withstand just about anything...together.This was the perfect 'taste' of the Browns to tide me over until Tart comes out.  One I highly recommend.","10 2, 2012",A3TGY3ANGBNK7C,"Cocktails and Books ""Shannon""",Reviewed for Cocktails and Books,1349136000

In this sequel, Kenna is reeling from witnessing what she thought was Arthur... the man she loves... killed before her eyes. But when she realizes this is not so...she experiences both anger and jubilation. Arthur explains that he along with several others, were working on removing the darkness that had entered Kenna by the end of the first book; In the first book she had gone rogue and began killing humans..who she deemed unfit and bad. But this was against the rules of her coven, (taught to her by Arthur her mentor and lover) where no human was to be killed. So now on Bora, Bora, Kenna goes through withdrawal and intense training to aide her in the upcoming fight against the Sirens....many twists, turns and surprises are in store for the reader in Don't Feed!I enjoyed both books...they were fun, sexy and fast paced.

B0088QDNBG,"[1, 1]",5,"The Sacred Breath Box Set is a remarkable collection of fantasy novels, each one having its own dynamic storyline and colorful characters. It was easy to breeze through each book with excitement and curiosity. I must commend the author's ability to pen in a well-written and creative way that allows for adults to shamelessly read paranormal romance and for young adults to read epic fantasy.Drowning Mermaids was engaging immediately as it allows the series to start on a very high note. It combined all the elements of romance with mystery and mystique as well. In Fathoms of Forgiveness, we turn to a much more high-stakes story with an unbelievable amount of conflict. It felt as if I was caught between the odds as Visola was. There is so much to learn and process from both Drowning Mermaids and Fathoms of Forgiveness about relationships and communication.In Boundless Sea, the author, Nadia Scrieva, takes a dramatic move and involves political, geographical, and social shifts that would be difficult for any reader to conceptualize at a surface level. Yet somehow, this incredible book makes those difficult mental leaps seamless and flawlessly delivered. Boundless seas made an incredible impression on me, and may be my favorite of all three. I just think that it is an untouchable book that stands out among similar books in the genre.In the last book of the series, Abyssal Zone brings much unfinished business to a close. As part of a bitter homecoming, the royal Aazuria finds herself in unfamiliar territory. She bravely navigates through her troubles with the wisdom and selflessness that we would expect from someone so regal. Embodying a true heroine, Abyssal Zone, ends the series on a spectacular note.Reading this collection is borderline life-changing. Each book weaves together a magical, paranormal romance wrapped up in epic fantasy.

You could also break it up if you wanted to. Maybe take a break after the uber smexy scene at the waterfall!Any additional comments?This book is mostly story with a few erotic scenes in the mix. I would not classify it as a romance at this point, no real feeling have been displayed. It also ends abruptly. It seems to be part of one book broken into a series of sections, not my favorite style. I like to get the whole story in one shot, I suck at waiting for the next book. Still it is a solid listen and I am curious to know what the games entail.Disclosure - I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

B007QXT6ZO,"[0, 0]",5,Bought this book because it took place in New Orleans & was about a psychic.  I was not disappointed.  The book grabs you from the start.  Very fast paced & just when you think it should be over - it starts all over again.  The authors descriptions of the swamps & streets of NOLA make you feel like you are watching the action.,"01 31, 2013",A1UBITPFPHXFMB,"L.

B00IJNDYV2,"[0, 0]",4,"I'm going to be honest with you and tell you straight up that that whole soul mate concept threw me off a time or three. Every other idea, though or emotion was bound to the soul mate concept so it was hard for me to keep a straight face. Yes, I am that skeptical.However, overlooking that little tidbit and focusing on the overall story I am happy to say that I loved it! Yes, Seth and Lucy's story was worth all my eye rolls.What made this story so enjoyable to me were the characters. Lucy was smart, caring and a great person all around. She felt real. She struggled with her emotions with her boyfriend but faced the truth of her relationship with him. What I admired most about her was her determination to find her own way and the way she faced her fears of the unknown about both relationships before acting out. She questioned, she pondered and did whatever was best for her. Her only fault was confronting those issues head on with the men in her life, but really who doesn't need a bit more time to get their head on straight?Seth was great, I loved him from the start. I enjoyed his sense of humor, his tenacity at getting to the bottom of what Lucy was making him feel and his caring ways. His story was sad, but that just made his new-found happiness that much more enjoyable to me.Needless to say that the chemistry between the two was explosive. From the moment they laid eyes on each other you could feel how strong their attraction for each other was. And that first encounter? Man, that was hot! Kudos to Deanna Chase for building up the anticipation and keeping me captivated throughout.But really, I would have to say that my favorite parts were when they were just hanging around, sharing their experiences and cementing their connection. I wish I could have seem more of that, but what was brought to the page was enough for me to cheer them on. I loved what they each brought out from one another. Together they were happy not just content. They would let their walls down and be themselves, which ultimately made their connection deeper and their coming together more believable in my eyes.All in all, a wonderful romantic read about two individuals that didn't settle for what they once had with other people but instead embraced what they had found in each other.","03 3, 2014",A3IT9Z7O9IK7BM,Shirley Quinones,A wonderful romantic read,1393804800

B006AC5FCU,"[0, 0]",4,"The Sun Zebra is a collection of five short stories written by R. Garcia. They are wonderful stories about the adventures in the life of a little girl, Nell, and her parents, and are told by her father. Perhaps this does not sound very intriguing, but don&#8217;t be fooled. Mr. Garcia writes with heart and humour, drawing the reader in as he cleverly tells his tale in an entertaining way, giving the reader the feeling of being there.Five stories. Five adventures:The Sun Zebra &#8211; after which the book was named;Bob the Intrepid Insectnaut!;Raven-Lenore;The Meaningless Christmas Tree;Birdman and the Fairy TaleThe preface begins, &#8220;This book is best described as a children&#8217;s book for grownups.&#8221; &#8211; and that&#8217;s a great way to begin. Each story inspires the reader to look at the seemingly insignificant things in life a little differently, and challenges one to see through the innocent eyes and understanding of a curious and thoughtful young child. As a delightful and easy read The Sun Zebra is enjoyable, interesting, funny, thought-provoking.R. Garcia also writes under the pen name of Phantomimic. He has a following on Scribd.com where he shares his work, and which encouraged him to write a book. The Sun Zebra is the result of that decision. It is well worth his effort and a pleasure to read.","02 24, 2014",A1WAFE0FZWA1BN,Lynn A. Davidson,puts a smile on one's heart,1393200000

This book has all the emotions of the first but seemed to lack the slightest nuance of the snappy dialogue that one had. The book had a great beginning and middle but the ending felt rushed. I would have preferred a longer book. Also, the prequel novella that was strongly suggested was basically rewritten as part of this book. As a result I am left feeling a bit fooled for purchasing both.","05 13, 2014",A334K0B8FVV77A,Kindle Customer,Fair follow up,1399939200
